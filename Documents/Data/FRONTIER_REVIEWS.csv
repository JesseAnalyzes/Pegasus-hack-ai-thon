Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 4 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 500 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $77/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure i was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

15,Google Reviews,"August 07, 2025",5,Michelle C.,"Oakland, CA","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $56/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 16 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $56 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",35,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/204609,,,,f
16,BBB,2025-10-23,1,User7542,Rural West Texas,"Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $51/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $102/month - over a 118% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 59 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 66% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 32 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $218 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/793632,False Advertising - Speeds Not as Promised,,f,

31,ConsumerAffairs,2025-04-16,1,User8913,"Frisco, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $110 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $245 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

59,Yelp,2025-03-13,5,User2932,"San Diego, CA","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address & honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $137 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",1,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/911499,,,,

79,Google Reviews,"July 01, 2025",1,User9211,"Long Beach, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $96 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $261 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",10,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/455889,,,,t

103,Trustpilot,2024-07-24,1,Carol N.,Rural North Texas,"Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 7 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $52/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $111/month - over a 90% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 76 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 64% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 41 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $228 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

106,Yelp,2024-10-11,1,Donald Z.,"San Diego, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $87 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $184 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",20,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/901491,,,,

108,ConsumerAffairs,2025-11-07,5,John W.,"Austin, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $72/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $103 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $72 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

148,Yelp,2025-10-21,1,Steve S.,"Irving, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago i called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $81 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $206 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If u ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",3,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/582804,,,,

151,Trustpilot,2024-11-20,5,User7383,Rural Northern California,"After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $84/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $90 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 16 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play.

195,Google Reviews,"August 31, 2025",2,Andrew F.,Rural South Texas,"Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $106/month - over a 126% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 37 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 69% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 45 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $345 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",1,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/252465,,,,t

204,Trustpilot,2025-02-12,1,User5499,"Oakland, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $69 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $277 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",32,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/721318,Still Waiting for Resolution,,t,

212,Yelp,2025-09-09,5,Anthony D.,"Corpus Christi, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $133 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",25,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/338803,,,,

241,BBB,2025-05-05,5,Steve F.,"Long Beach, CA","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $88/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back.

Three months ago i called to cancel my service because i was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $75 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $218 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office.

The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 92 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 49% of what I'm paying for.

311,Google Reviews,"September 29, 2024",1,Donald J.,"Carrollton, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $128/month - over a 104% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 82 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 39% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 16 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $279 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

327,BBB,2025-04-20,5,Michelle W.,"Fresno, CA","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $90/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $119 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $90 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

344,Trustpilot,2024-10-04,1,Susan H.,"Dallas, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago i called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $104 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $322 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",3,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/739205,Unprofessional Installation,,t,

349,Yelp,2024-09-02,1,User4281,"Mesquite, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 16 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $48/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $110/month - over a 150% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $22 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 79 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 37% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 25 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $257 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",26,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/209735,,,,

354,Trustpilot,2024-07-26,5,Michelle A.,"Fort Worth, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $97 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

396,BBB,2024-10-20,2,Richard C.,"Anaheim, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $84 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $325 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

417,ConsumerAffairs,2025-08-26,5,Sarah D.,"Fremont, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $57/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $140 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $57 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $60 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $326 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $106/month - over a 122% increase!! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $16/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 85 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 20 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $381 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

530,ConsumerAffairs,2024-11-21,1,Nancy C.,"Irvine, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $43/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $105/month - over a 137% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 39% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 38 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $362 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

544,Trustpilot,2024-10-05,2,Nicole K.,"Long Beach, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 12 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $48/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 105% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 53 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 48% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 35 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $243 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",26,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/432354,Unprofessional Installation,,t,
545,Trustpilot,2024-08-20,5,Brian Y.,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $86/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $133 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $86 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",15,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/508608,Excellent Fiber Internet,,f,

552,BBB,2024-08-08,1,Sarah R.,"Houston, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $103 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $267 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/614856,Avoid if Possible,,t,

593,BBB,2025-03-18,5,Margaret L.,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $110 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/248538,5 Stars - Would Recommend,,t,

596,Google Reviews,"August 08, 2024",1,Richard P.,"Los Angeles, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $101 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $294 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",18,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/145698,,,,t

648,Google Reviews,"April 09, 2025",5,Kevin T.,"Arlington, TX","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $83/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $106 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $83 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",47,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/262631,,,,t

706,Google Reviews,"June 04, 2025",1,John L.,"Fremont, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 14 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $54/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $93/month - over a 116% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 82 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 54% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 26 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $254 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",50,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/995823,,,,t

713,BBB,2025-08-15,5,Patricia B.,"Austin, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $53/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $123 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $53 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

811,BBB,2024-09-10,5,Matthew Z.,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $109 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

855,ConsumerAffairs,2025-08-24,2,Steve W.,"Anaheim, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $94 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $234 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

894,Google Reviews,"May 23, 2024",1,Brian S.,"Sacramento, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 8 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $122/month - over a 138% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 79 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 45 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $387 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

897,ConsumerAffairs,2024-12-20,5,Jessica J.,"Long Beach, CA","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $74/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $108 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $74 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

918,BBB,2025-04-02,1,User2806,"San Antonio, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 5 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $44/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $117/month - over a 101% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $17 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 68 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 56% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 44 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $319 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

921,Google Reviews,"February 25, 2025",5,Amanda S.,"Sacramento, CA","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $63/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $121 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $63 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",13,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/804048,,,,t

Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $52 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 14 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $67/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

994,ConsumerAffairs,2024-10-08,1,Susan D.,"Fort Worth, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $81 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $288 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

1003,Google Reviews,"April 07, 2025",1,User1054,"Oakland, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 16 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $44/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $118/month - over a 143% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 92 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 65% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 38 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $282 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $83/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $105 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps.

Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $70 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $273 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office.

1021,Trustpilot,2025-10-23,5,User2975,Rural North Texas,"After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $87/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $111 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $87 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

1046,Yelp,2025-07-14,1,Daniel W.,"Corpus Christi, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 17 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $52/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $109/month - over a 142% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 78 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 29 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $260 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",43,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/766920,,,,

1081,Yelp,2024-12-13,5,Linda L.,"San Francisco, CA","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $59/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $133 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play.

1101,BBB,2025-08-17,1,Andrew E.,"Fort Worth, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $106 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $247 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $67 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $243 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",8,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/748665,,,,t

I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $36/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $117/month - over a 94% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $10 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 39 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 59% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 36 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible.

1153,Trustpilot,2024-12-27,5,Steve S.,"Anaheim, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $123 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $82 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",23,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/771895,Professional Installation,,f,

I signed up for Frontier 12 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $55/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $130/month - over a 132% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $20 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 86 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 53% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 37 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $381 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $78 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes.

1237,ConsumerAffairs,2025-09-26,5,Angela K.,"Fresno, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $52/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $52 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

1257,Trustpilot,2025-06-05,1,Nancy M.,"Austin, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $86 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $183 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

1260,Google Reviews,"February 08, 2025",5,User7358,"Houston, TX","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household.. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 14 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",18,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/201728,,,,t

That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $102/month - over a 138% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $25/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $12 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 64 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 49% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 34 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible.

1303,Google Reviews,"April 30, 2025",4,Emily L.,"Carrollton, TX","Switched to Frontier Fiber 8 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (Xfinity) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 6 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $85/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",5,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/515423,,,,t

I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $50/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $110/month - over a 113% increase!! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 97 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 51% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 41 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $384 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $80 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $313 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office.

1378,Google Reviews,"June 25, 2025",5,User7998,"San Diego, CA","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $53/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $115 I was paying AT&T for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $53 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",32,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/671320,,,,f

1392,ConsumerAffairs,2025-05-11,1,Sarah L.,"Fresno, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $49/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $97/month - over a 150% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 42 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 37% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 22 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $229 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 7 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $77/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs.

1411,Trustpilot,2024-12-16,5,Joseph P.,"Sacramento, CA","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $51/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $120 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $51 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

1417,ConsumerAffairs,2025-10-04,1,Mark B.,Rural South Texas,"Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $46/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $117/month - over a 99% increase!!! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $22 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 84 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 35% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 18 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $372 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $393 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",10,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/875074,,,,

1473,Trustpilot,2025-05-13,5,David N.,"Houston, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $56/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $97 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $56 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",27,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/726923,Smooth Experience,,t,

1504,BBB,2025-10-31,5,User9811,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $76/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $114 I was paying Spectrum for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $76 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $55/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $95 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back.

1594,BBB,2024-08-10,5,User9671,"Arlington, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/618521,Solid Performance,,t,

1596,Yelp,2025-08-23,1,Jennifer G.,"Irving, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service.. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, & returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $88 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $263 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

1619,BBB,2024-07-25,1,Joseph Y.,"El Paso, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $65 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $277 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

1627,BBB,2025-10-01,5,User1867,"Frisco, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $73 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $308 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

1672,Yelp,2025-09-24,5,User6370,Rural North Texas,"After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $54/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $103 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $54 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

1676,Yelp,2025-06-08,1,Nancy N.,"Houston, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 14 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $46/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $105/month - over a 93% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 34 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 44% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 28 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $356 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

1737,BBB,2025-04-30,5,User8515,"Fremont, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address & honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $69/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $128 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $69 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing.

1754,BBB,2024-08-02,1,Steve H.,"Bakersfield, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $94 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $308 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

1764,Yelp,2024-07-08,1,User1886,"Oakland, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $40/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $116/month - over a 99% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 42 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 59% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 17 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $290 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",32,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/155311,,,,

1777,ConsumerAffairs,2025-09-12,5,User9182,"Sacramento, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $81/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $108 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $81 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $98 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $296 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

1812,ConsumerAffairs,2025-02-22,1,William L.,"Corpus Christi, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $98/month - over a 81% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 92 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 66% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 23 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $397 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

1841,Trustpilot,2025-01-17,5,Nancy K.,"Austin, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $113 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $75 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $304 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/960176,Worst ISP Experience Ever,,f,

1908,BBB,2024-06-13,5,Kevin R.,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $75/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $96 I was paying AT&T for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $75 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/667945,Finally Reliable Internet,,t,

1982,ConsumerAffairs,2024-11-07,5,Matthew B.,"Long Beach, CA","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $64/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $139 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 16 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $64 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",24,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/935681,Excellent Fiber Internet,f,,

I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $84 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/337813,Fiber Changed Everything,,f,

2004,Google Reviews,"March 17, 2025",1,User8313,"Corpus Christi, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 8 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $55/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $102/month - over a 120% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $21/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 43 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 58% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 35 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $316 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

2038,BBB,2025-08-08,1,Daniel D.,Rural Northern California,"I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called 2 cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $77 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $256 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

2047,ConsumerAffairs,2024-12-04,5,Joseph K.,Rural Central Texas,"After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $56/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $119 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $56 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing.

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $70 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $324 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",31,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/953716,,,,

2058,Trustpilot,2024-09-18,5,Paul T.,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $87/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $107 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 8 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $87 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",35,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/137497,Excellent Fiber Internet,,t,

I signed up for Frontier 5 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $115/month - over a 138% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $16/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 66 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 63% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 17 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless.

2115,Trustpilot,2024-09-18,1,William T.,"Fort Worth, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $92 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $232 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",39,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/846957,Save Your Money - Go Elsewhere,,f,

2121,Google Reviews,"October 06, 2025",5,Betty L.,"Austin, TX","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address & honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $69/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $113 I was paying AT&T for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $69 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing.

2148,Yelp,2024-07-24,5,Sandra F.,"Carrollton, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household.. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $77/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $91 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 18 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $77 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",47,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/370049,,,,

2158,Yelp,2024-09-12,1,Mark D.,"Austin, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 5 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $35/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 104% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 41 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 53% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 44 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 10 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $330 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",14,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/365868,,,,

2165,Google Reviews,"June 11, 2024",1,Brian J.,"Houston, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $85 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $223 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 30 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 68% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 25 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 4 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $352 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1500 sq ft home.

2215,Google Reviews,"October 14, 2024",5,Anthony W.,"Los Angeles, CA","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $85/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $98 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $85 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",42,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/547064,,,,f

2254,Yelp,2025-09-17,1,Nicole K.,"San Antonio, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 17 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $46/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $112/month - over a 88% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 32 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 45% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 45 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $382 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

2265,BBB,2025-08-06,1,User8431,"Anaheim, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $66 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $322 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

2278,Yelp,2025-06-29,5,Richard A.,"Corpus Christi, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 17 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $82 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

2294,ConsumerAffairs,2025-10-31,1,Robert C.,"Sacramento, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $81 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $330 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",5,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/936917,Billing Nightmare,t,,

2297,ConsumerAffairs,2025-09-12,5,Sarah M.,"Fresno, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $88/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $118 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 17 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $88 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $74 every single month on my credit card!! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $244 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

2403,BBB,2024-11-16,5,Jennifer P.,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $139 I was paying Spectrum for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/387378,Smooth Experience,,t,
2404,Trustpilot,2024-10-19,1,Anthony M.,"Bakersfield, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $129/month - over a 149% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 69 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 57% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 40 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $339 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

2455,BBB,2024-09-07,2,User7523,"Fort Worth, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $85 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $219 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

2459,Google Reviews,"June 30, 2025",1,Karen B.,"San Antonio, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $49/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $111/month - over a 109% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 70 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 64% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 20 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $237 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",3,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/426977,,,,t

2461,BBB,2024-07-03,5,User5565,"San Francisco, CA","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $71/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $112 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $71 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/559960,Good Value for Money,,t,

2560,BBB,2025-09-08,1,Lisa N.,"Oakland, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $60 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $216 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/267204,Hidden Fees Everywhere,,t,

I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $43/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $113/month - over a 149% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 48 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 51% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 22 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $363 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

2599,BBB,2024-06-06,5,Thomas F.,"San Francisco, CA","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $81/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $90 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $81 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/291901,Solid Performance,,t,

2632,Google Reviews,"July 08, 2024",5,Ashley A.,"Oakland, CA","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $67/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $114 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 14 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $67 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

2636,BBB,2024-12-31,1,User5454,"Houston, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $100 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $208 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

2654,Google Reviews,"June 20, 2024",1,User5067,Rural Central Texas,"Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $53/month with 'no hidden fees..' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $97/month - over a 86% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), & $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 79 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 61% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 33 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $277 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

2670,ConsumerAffairs,2025-05-22,5,John K.,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $131 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",12,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/476748,Great Service!,t,,

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $108 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $322 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

2700,Google Reviews,"July 15, 2024",1,Susan A.,"Fort Worth, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $51/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $113/month - over a 81% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 71 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 47% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 19 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $324 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $96/month - over a 92% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 60% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 31 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible.

2756,BBB,2025-02-07,1,Amanda W.,"Santa Ana, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $76 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $258 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

2764,Yelp,2024-05-27,2,Amanda W.,"Frisco, TX","Where do i even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $46/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $106/month - over a 116% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 70 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 65% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 37 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $281 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",49,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/879741,,,,

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $79 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $294 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

2795,Yelp,2025-08-02,5,Robert Z.,"Sacramento, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $68/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $128 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $68 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

2804,Yelp,2024-09-09,5,User1363,"Arlington, TX","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $74/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $121 I was paying AT&T for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $74 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",6,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/558449,,,,

2823,BBB,2025-07-18,2,User9002,"Fort Worth, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $89 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $307 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $57 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",16,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/960402,,,,t

2882,Google Reviews,"June 13, 2025",5,Amanda W.,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $112 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files.

2887,Trustpilot,2025-01-12,1,Paul D.,"Corpus Christi, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 18 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 84% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $23 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 90 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 36 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $306 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

2901,Trustpilot,2025-06-16,1,Carol D.,"El Paso, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $65 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $210 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",2,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/697660,Hidden Fees Everywhere,,t,

2926,Google Reviews,"June 02, 2025",5,Linda E.,"Long Beach, CA","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $80/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $107 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 8 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $80 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $45/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $94/month - over a 122% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $21/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $16 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 99 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 63% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 35 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $400 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 48% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 17 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $335 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $102 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $285 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

2974,ConsumerAffairs,2025-09-24,5,Maria F.,"Fresno, CA","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $59/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $106 I was paying AT&T for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $59 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",42,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/240762,Solid Performance,t,,

The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $88 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",2,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/660410,Fast and Reliable,,t,

3032,Google Reviews,"November 20, 2024",1,Betty G.,Rural Southern California,"I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $82 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $276 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",27,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/543699,,,,t

Customer service is terrible - I've called 4 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $49 to $100 per month with no warning.

3070,ConsumerAffairs,2024-08-18,5,Sarah F.,"San Jose, CA","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $130 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 14 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $82 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $263 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

3078,Google Reviews,"November 05, 2024",1,Daniel H.,"Houston, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $49/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $130/month - over a 132% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $20 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 57 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 62% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 29 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $206 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

3098,Yelp,2025-01-18,5,User6972,"Fort Worth, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $77/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $96 I was paying Spectrum for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $77 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",26,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/203921,,,,

3111,Google Reviews,"May 23, 2024",1,James F.,"Corpus Christi, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $94 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $214 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

3134,Google Reviews,"April 23, 2025",2,Emily E.,"Corpus Christi, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $51/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $92/month - over a 95% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $25/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $15 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 59% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 30 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $244 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

3158,Google Reviews,"February 13, 2025",1,Richard T.,"Santa Ana, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called 2 cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $72 every single month on my credit card!! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $238 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

3237,Google Reviews,"October 09, 2024",5,Daniel F.,"Plano, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $52/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $116 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $52 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",47,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/794197,,,,t

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 1000 Mbps, other times dropping to 38 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 8 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $45 to $102 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers.

3245,Yelp,2025-10-09,1,Matthew R.,"Riverside, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $124/month - over a 145% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $21/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 81 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 39% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 34 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $277 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",22,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/593697,,,,

3275,Google Reviews,"May 27, 2025",5,Donald J.,"El Paso, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $57/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $132 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $57 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",13,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/382213,,,,t

I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $53/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $120/month - over a 136% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $15 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 97 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 37% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 21 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $362 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

3318,ConsumerAffairs,2024-11-17,5,Mark Y.,"Long Beach, CA","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $55/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $97 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $55 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $76 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $187 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

3358,Trustpilot,2025-04-17,1,Angela S.,"San Jose, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $38/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $120/month - over a 107% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 84 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 47% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 26 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $210 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

3393,ConsumerAffairs,2025-10-26,5,Linda R.,"Glendale, CA","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $83/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $131 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $83 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $69 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $256 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score.

3442,Trustpilot,2025-07-17,5,User2308,"Houston, TX","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $107 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",25,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/362311,Best ISP I've Had,,t,

3444,Google Reviews,"January 20, 2025",1,Jennifer Z.,"San Diego, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $69 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $285 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",41,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/517385,,,,f

3489,ConsumerAffairs,2024-11-26,1,Margaret M.,"Austin, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago i called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $91 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $242 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",39,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/883374,Worst ISP Experience Ever,t,,

3504,ConsumerAffairs,2025-03-11,5,Lisa W.,"Fort Worth, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $70/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $100 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $70 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

3525,BBB,2024-05-30,5,Nancy F.,"Fremont, CA","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $51/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $119 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 14 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $51 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

3527,Trustpilot,2025-03-16,1,Kevin L.,"San Jose, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $98 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $279 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

3528,Yelp,2024-12-29,1,Joseph Y.,"Fort Worth, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $121/month - over a 124% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 53 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 56% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 34 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $237 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",23,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/818899,,,,

3574,Trustpilot,2024-12-05,1,Jessica W.,"Sacramento, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 14 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $112/month - over a 116% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 55 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 44% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 35 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 4 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $289 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

3604,BBB,2025-10-14,5,Jennifer S.,"Fort Worth, TX","After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $50/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $125 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 9 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $50 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/858134,Professional Installation,,t,

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 5 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $74/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

3631,ConsumerAffairs,2025-09-17,5,User2237,"Grand Prairie, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $76/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $114 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $76 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",50,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/844435,Reliable and Fast,t,,

Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $92 every single month on my credit card!

One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $200 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office.

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $95 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $217 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June!

I signed up for Frontier 18 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $113/month - over a 125% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $25/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 93 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 68% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 23 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $203 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

3692,Trustpilot,2025-02-22,5,Ashley H.,"Irving, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $77/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $116 I was paying Spectrum for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $77 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",17,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/884333,Professional Installation,,f,

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $107 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $71 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback.

I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $43/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $111/month - over a 117% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $21/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $23 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 74 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 48% of what I'm paying for.

3729,ConsumerAffairs,2024-07-18,5,Michael F.,"Grand Prairie, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $51/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 18 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $51 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

3767,Trustpilot,2024-12-05,5,Lisa N.,"San Antonio, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $67/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $100 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 17 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $67 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",19,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/947445,Smooth Experience,,t,
3768,ConsumerAffairs,2025-02-20,1,Nancy P.,"Frisco, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $52/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 128% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 52 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 62% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 43 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $358 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

3779,BBB,2025-04-27,1,Anthony A.,"Plano, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $102 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $271 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/611260,Service Gets Worse Over Time,,t,

I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.'

3818,BBB,2025-09-04,5,Brian R.,Rural Central California,"After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $95 I was paying AT&T for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $82 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/318556,5 Stars - Would Recommend,,t,

3890,Google Reviews,"April 09, 2025",2,User2286,"Houston, TX","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $80 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $215 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

3905,Trustpilot,2024-10-16,5,Angela J.,"Los Angeles, CA","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $60/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $111 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $60 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",10,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/243809,Solid Performance,,t,

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $97 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $281 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score.

3926,Google Reviews,"July 19, 2025",5,Donald A.,"Los Angeles, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $90 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $82 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",35,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/398473,,,,t

3953,Yelp,2024-09-30,5,Steve L.,"Sacramento, CA","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $64/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $103 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $64 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",19,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/153836,,,,

4026,BBB,2025-03-28,5,Nicole L.,"Sacramento, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $78/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $140 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $78 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/884031,Best ISP I've Had,,t,

4071,Yelp,2024-07-18,5,Michael N.,"Plano, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $79/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $79 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",44,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/866765,,,,

4090,BBB,2024-06-18,2,Patricia F.,"San Antonio, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $129/month - over a 83% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $23 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 96 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 59% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 20 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $205 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

4093,Trustpilot,2024-12-08,1,Christopher J.,"Stockton, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $86 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $219 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

4104,Trustpilot,2024-08-30,5,User1388,"Sacramento, CA","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $99 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 17 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",38,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/142257,Reliable and Fast,,t,

4150,BBB,2025-04-15,2,Karen R.,"San Jose, CA","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $126/month - over a 80% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $17 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 42 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 39% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 39 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $386 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

4159,Trustpilot,2024-08-07,5,David Z.,"Garland, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $63/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $122 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 18 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $63 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",47,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/457549,Fiber Changed Everything,,t,

4218,Google Reviews,"August 02, 2025",2,Ashley L.,"Los Angeles, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $107 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $245 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

4229,ConsumerAffairs,2025-08-14,5,User1518,"Garland, TX","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $57/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $101 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $57 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",28,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/659857,Reliable and Fast,t,,

I signed up for Frontier 18 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $125/month - over a 127% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 40 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 55% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 40 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $334 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

4272,Trustpilot,2024-06-04,5,Andrew H.,"Fort Worth, TX","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $62/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $101 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 8 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $62 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",35,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/685017,Very Satisfied,,t,

4278,ConsumerAffairs,2024-10-22,1,Karen M.,"Irvine, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $87 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $314 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

4304,Yelp,2025-07-20,5,User7779,"San Jose, CA","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $78/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $124 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $78 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",3,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/319404,,,,

I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $44/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $100/month - over a 128% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $20 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 70 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 44% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 30 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 10 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $328 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $66 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $253 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

4348,Google Reviews,"June 10, 2025",2,Nancy Z.,"Fresno, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $87 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $197 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",5,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/250487,,,,t

4352,Yelp,2025-03-06,5,Christopher R.,"Carrollton, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $70/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $122 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $70 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",19,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/819381,,,,

I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $66/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $116 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $66 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",19,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/729860,Happy Customer,t,,

4399,ConsumerAffairs,2025-11-02,1,Patricia W.,"Garland, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 7 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $54/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $112/month - over a 90% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 69 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 66% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 37 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $363 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $74 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $247 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $68/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $122 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps.

The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood.

The billing has been exactly as promised too - $68 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

4473,BBB,2025-03-15,1,Mark P.,Rural Southern California,"Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $47/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $105/month - over a 143% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $16/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $17 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 56 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 50% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 15 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $281 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $108 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $314 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers.

4535,BBB,2025-04-30,5,Michelle S.,"San Diego, CA","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $67/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $106 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $67 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing.

Asked about running them through walls, was told that costs extra. The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 1800 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $106. Service works okay but not worth the hassle. Support is slow to respond and unhelpful. Been with them 8 months and counting down until contract ends.

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 7 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $61/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $126/month - over a 89% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 43% of what I'm paying for.

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $99 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $246 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score.

4600,Trustpilot,2025-08-30,5,Susan Z.,"Arlington, TX","After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $65/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $65 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",5,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/383759,Reliable and Fast,,t,

4616,Yelp,2025-04-09,1,Mark E.,"San Diego, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $81 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $286 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",36,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/534827,,,,

4651,BBB,2025-08-21,5,Mark L.,"Austin, TX","After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $85/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $127 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $85 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/427733,Excellent Fiber Internet,,t,

I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 113% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 62% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 33 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help.

4684,Trustpilot,2025-07-20,2,User9379,Rural Southern California,"I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $76 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $279 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

4708,BBB,2025-07-10,5,User2783,"Dallas, TX","After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $50/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $132 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $50 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $47/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $100/month - over a 82% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $16/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $17 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 36 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 67% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 36 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 4 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $278 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

4747,Google Reviews,"November 08, 2024",5,Amanda Y.,"Oakland, CA","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $81/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $93 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $81 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",4,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/445414,,,,t

I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped 2 $105/month - over a 131% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 80 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 47% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 25 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible.

The early termination fee is $264 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $108 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed.

Meanwhile I'm out $249 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office.

The early termination fee is $371 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

4792,ConsumerAffairs,2025-08-29,5,Robert L.,"Santa Ana, CA","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $51/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $135 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $51 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",42,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/120263,Great Service!,t,,

Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $79 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $267 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges.

I signed up for Frontier 5 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $36/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $92/month - over a 104% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 49 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 42% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 17 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible.

4859,Trustpilot,2024-10-06,1,Angela J.,"Anaheim, CA","I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $105 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $328 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",38,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/145198,Billed for Service I Don't Have,,f,

I signed up for Frontier 17 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $50/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped 2 $104/month - over a 128% increase!! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 46 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 51% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 24 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 10 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $359 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

4989,Trustpilot,2025-02-23,1,Robert D.,"Plano, TX","Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 16 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $36/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $104/month - over a 134% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 33 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 57% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 23 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $205 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB.

4997,Google Reviews,"September 12, 2025",5,Michelle D.,"Los Angeles, CA","After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $50/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $99 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $50 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",0,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/133807,,,,t
