10000,Yelp,2024-11-09,4,Ashley Z.,Rural Central California,"Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 11 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 218-238 Mbps download and 240-260 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 11 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10002,ConsumerAffairs,2025-03-28,5,Matthew D.,"Anaheim, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 9 months: After 9 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1028 Mbps down and 1044 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 9 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10003,ConsumerAffairs,2025-02-15,4,Joshua D.,"Santa Ana, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 20 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 20 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a marketing consultant, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (519 Mbps down, 535 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 499 Mbps down or 515 Mbps up. Most tests show 519+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 20 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 20 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",21,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/10003,Outstanding Experience,False,False,False

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 500 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience.

I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 529 Mbps down or 500 Mbps up. Most tests show 549+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 10 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 10 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important).

10010,Trustpilot,2024-12-18,5,Dorothy S.,Rural Southern California,"Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: After 13 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 522 Mbps down and 541 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 13 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",8,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/10010,,False,True,False

Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network.

When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1023 Mbps download and 1024 Mbps upload on speed tests.

That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops.

10023,ConsumerAffairs,2024-10-15,5,James D.,"San Jose, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 13 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a video editor, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (545 Mbps down, 528 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 525 Mbps down or 508 Mbps up. Most tests show 545+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 13 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 13 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important).

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 233-253 Mbps download and 248-268 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 16 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 222 Mbps down and 228 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

10031,ConsumerAffairs,2025-07-24,5,Tom D.,Rural Northern California,"Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 5 months: After 5 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1031 Mbps down and 1047 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 5 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10032,Trustpilot,2025-01-08,5,Stephanie V.,"Corpus Christi, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 13 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (515 Mbps down, 527 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 495 Mbps down or 507 Mbps up. Most tests show 515+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 13 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 13 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",45,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/10032,Exceeded My Expectations,False,True,False

When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics.

Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 249-269 Mbps download and 244-264 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 9 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I signed up for their 200 Mbps fiber service 22 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($50/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 200 Mbps, but I consistently get 229 Mbps download and 226 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 22 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a marketing consultant, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1027 Mbps down, 1027 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1007 Mbps down or 1007 Mbps up. Most tests show 1027+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 20 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 20 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Small business owner working from home.

10048,Yelp,2024-06-12,4,Michelle D.,"Fremont, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 8 months: After 8 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 250 Mbps down and 243 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 8 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 234 Mbps down and 215 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

10050,Yelp,2024-12-18,5,Tom J.,"Arlington, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 17 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 17 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1030 Mbps down, 1047 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1010 Mbps down or 1027 Mbps up. Most tests show 1030+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 17 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 17 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical).

10051,Yelp,2025-03-08,5,Michelle D.,"Houston, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 7 months: After 7 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1044 Mbps down and 1047 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 7 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1016-1036 Mbps download and 1040-1060 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 23 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password.

10059,Trustpilot,2024-12-04,4,Elizabeth Y.,"San Jose, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: After 11 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 522 Mbps down and 531 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 11 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10063,Trustpilot,2024-07-31,4,Sarah S.,"San Francisco, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 12 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 12 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1024 Mbps down, 1047 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1004 Mbps down or 1027 Mbps up. Most tests show 1024+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 12 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 12 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 500 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 542 Mbps down and 550 Mbps up on my 500 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 3 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1021 Mbps download and 1036 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 3 months, I've had exactly 0 outages. Zero downtime is incredible for any ISP. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10075,Yelp,2025-10-20,4,Daniel W.,"Sacramento, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 10 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 10 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (522 Mbps down, 535 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 502 Mbps down or 515 Mbps up. Most tests show 522+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 10 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 10 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Small business owner working from home.

10077,Yelp,2024-11-10,5,Matthew I.,"Anaheim, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: After 11 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve.

10078,Yelp,2025-10-03,5,Rachel J.,"Anaheim, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 15 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 15 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1050 Mbps down, 1050 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1030 Mbps down or 1030 Mbps up. Most tests show 1050+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 15 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 15 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important).

10079,Yelp,2024-07-30,5,Ashley Y.,"Oakland, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: After 11 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1026-1046 Mbps download and 1047-1067 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 8 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

10086,Trustpilot,2025-06-01,5,Mark Z.,Rural Southern California,"Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 5 months: After 5 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 234 Mbps down and 222 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 5 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1048 Mbps down and 1024 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

10089,Yelp,2025-01-09,5,Joshua N.,"Fremont, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 18 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 18 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1025 Mbps down, 1023 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1005 Mbps down or 1003 Mbps up. Most tests show 1025+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 18 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 18 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important).

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 500 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 530-550 Mbps download and 540-560 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 12 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1044 Mbps down and 1038 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

10099,BBB,2025-10-12,5,Emily E.,Rural Central Texas,"Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 11 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (234 Mbps down, 236 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 214 Mbps down or 216 Mbps up. Most tests show 234+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 11 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 11 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/10099,Couldn't Be Happier,True,False,False

10103,Trustpilot,2025-06-24,5,Joseph R.,"Sacramento, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: After 13 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 543 Mbps down and 526 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 13 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10105,Yelp,2025-07-15,4,Jason K.,"McKinney, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 17 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 17 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a software developer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1048 Mbps down, 1045 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1028 Mbps down or 1025 Mbps up. Most tests show 1048+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 17 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 17 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",0,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/10105,Flawless Installation and Service,False,True,False
10106,ConsumerAffairs,2024-11-24,5,Susan D.,Rural West Texas,"Network Performance Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: I need to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with Frontier Fiber. I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 11 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1039 Mbps download and 1041 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 11 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10107,BBB,2024-08-14,5,Thomas A.,"Arlington, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 6 months: After 6 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 528 Mbps down and 539 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 6 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 500 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network.

10115,Google Reviews,2025-02-04,5,Charles V.,"McKinney, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 11 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a marketing consultant, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (535 Mbps down, 545 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 515 Mbps down or 525 Mbps up. Most tests show 535+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 11 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 11 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",1,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/10115,Highly Recommend Frontier,False,True,False
10116,BBB,2024-07-21,5,William R.,Rural Northern California,"Network Performance Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 8 months: I need to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with Frontier Fiber. I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 8 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1048 Mbps download and 1028 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 8 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 229 Mbps down and 235 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1026-1046 Mbps download and 1029-1049 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 14 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10125,Google Reviews,2025-01-06,4,Rachel R.,"McKinney, TX","Network Performance Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 15 months: I need to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with Frontier Fiber. I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 15 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1038 Mbps download and 1046 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 15 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1030 Mbps down and 1021 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

10127,BBB,2025-08-16,5,Michelle A.,"Corpus Christi, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 10 months: After 10 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 537 Mbps down and 545 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 10 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10128,Trustpilot,2025-05-10,5,Charles X.,"Corpus Christi, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 18 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 18 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (515 Mbps down, 544 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 495 Mbps down or 524 Mbps up. Most tests show 515+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 18 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 18 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical).

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password.

10134,ConsumerAffairs,2024-07-30,5,Amanda G.,"Long Beach, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 5 months: After 5 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1041 Mbps down and 1018 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 5 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10135,ConsumerAffairs,2025-03-30,5,David R.,"Corpus Christi, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 8 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 8 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a software developer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (234 Mbps down, 247 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 214 Mbps down or 227 Mbps up. Most tests show 234+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 8 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 8 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important).

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 248-268 Mbps download and 222-242 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 18 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 14 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",0,https://example.com/reviews/bbb/10143,Highly Recommend Frontier,False,True,False

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1025 Mbps down and 1018 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

10145,Google Reviews,2025-08-24,5,Michelle K.,"El Paso, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 20 months: After 20 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 239 Mbps down and 235 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 20 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10148,Google Reviews,2025-03-23,5,Patricia N.,Rural Southern California,"Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 11 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (222 Mbps down, 248 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 202 Mbps down or 228 Mbps up. Most tests show 222+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 11 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 11 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing.

10153,Google Reviews,2025-10-14,5,Ashley B.,Rural Central Texas,"Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 22 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 22 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1028-1048 Mbps download and 1026-1046 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 22 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 249 Mbps down and 217 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

10155,Yelp,2025-02-11,5,Emily W.,"Anaheim, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 7 months: After 7 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1023 Mbps down and 1022 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 7 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10156,ConsumerAffairs,2024-11-27,5,Donald D.,"Dallas, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 16 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 16 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a marketing consultant, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1037 Mbps down, 1015 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1017 Mbps down or 995 Mbps up. Most tests show 1037+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 16 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 16 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home.

I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 12 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1021 Mbps download and 1049 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 12 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 500 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 518-538 Mbps download and 524-544 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home.

I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 548 Mbps down and 541 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 8 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 230 Mbps down and 234 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 500 Mbps, but I consistently get 530 Mbps download and 517 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 8 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (530 Mbps down, 527 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 510 Mbps down or 507 Mbps up. Most tests show 530+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 23 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 23 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important).

10179,Yelp,2025-09-04,5,Joshua Y.,"Oakland, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 8 months: After 8 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1030 Mbps down and 1017 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 8 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10180,Trustpilot,2025-09-11,5,Michael E.,"McKinney, TX","Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 4 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 4 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience.

I signed up for their 200 Mbps fiber service 4 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($50/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 200 Mbps, but I consistently get 241 Mbps download and 221 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 4 months, I've had exactly 0 outages. Zero downtime is incredible for any ISP. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1047 Mbps down and 1048 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

10185,Yelp,2025-01-13,5,James O.,Rural West Texas,"Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 6 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 6 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a software developer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1033 Mbps down, 1045 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1013 Mbps down or 1025 Mbps up. Most tests show 1033+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 6 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 6 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once for help with router settings. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices.

10189,Trustpilot,2025-01-06,5,Nicole R.,"Irving, TX","Network Performance Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 19 months: I need to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with Frontier Fiber. I signed up for their 200 Mbps fiber service 19 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($50/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 200 Mbps, but I consistently get 235 Mbps download and 225 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 19 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed.

10194,ConsumerAffairs,2024-10-15,5,Sarah I.,"Fremont, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 17 months: After 17 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 242 Mbps down and 246 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 17 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10198,BBB,2024-10-27,4,Steven C.,"Santa Ana, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 16 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 16 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a marketing consultant, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1023 Mbps down, 1028 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1003 Mbps down or 1008 Mbps up. Most tests show 1023+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 16 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 16 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical).

10200,ConsumerAffairs,2024-12-26,5,Richard B.,"Houston, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 10 months: After 10 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 240 Mbps down and 239 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 10 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 235 Mbps down and 225 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (516 Mbps down, 527 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 496 Mbps down or 507 Mbps up. Most tests show 516+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 17 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 17 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try.

10204,Google Reviews,2024-12-17,4,Daniel G.,"Glendale, CA","Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 8 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 8 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 249-269 Mbps download and 249-269 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 8 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 11 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 11 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (231 Mbps down, 235 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1026 Mbps down and 1029 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 16 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1049 Mbps download and 1037 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 16 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 248-268 Mbps download and 223-243 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 19 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

I signed up for their 500 Mbps fiber service 14 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($70/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 500 Mbps, but I consistently get 541 Mbps download and 518 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 14 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10219,Google Reviews,2025-07-29,5,Nancy O.,"Houston, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 23 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 23 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1018 Mbps down, 1031 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 998 Mbps down or 1011 Mbps up. Most tests show 1018+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 23 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 23 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important).

10220,ConsumerAffairs,2025-01-26,5,Amanda J.,"Irving, TX","Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 17 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 17 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1025-1045 Mbps download and 1017-1037 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 17 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10221,Google Reviews,2025-08-16,5,Anthony X.,Rural Central California,"Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: After 13 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 246 Mbps down and 241 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 13 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 23 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",32,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/10227,Superior to Cable,True,False,False

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1028 Mbps down and 1019 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

10229,Yelp,2025-06-21,5,Joshua Q.,"Austin, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 16 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 16 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a video editor, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (516 Mbps down, 515 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 496 Mbps down or 495 Mbps up. Most tests show 516+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 16 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 16 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",54,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/10229,,False,False,False

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 500 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 544-564 Mbps download and 526-546 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 23 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 3 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 3 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once for help with router settings. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1024 Mbps down and 1015 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

10242,Google Reviews,2025-09-11,5,Anthony A.,"Glendale, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 4 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 4 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a video editor, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (234 Mbps down, 231 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 214 Mbps down or 211 Mbps up. Most tests show 234+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 4 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 4 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once for help with router settings.

I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 22 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 22 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try.

10246,Trustpilot,2025-05-04,5,Anthony L.,Rural South Texas,"Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 7 months: After 7 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 530 Mbps down and 536 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 7 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms.

I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service.

10249,ConsumerAffairs,2025-04-15,5,Jessica G.,Rural Southern California,"Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 20 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 20 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 500 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 516-536 Mbps download and 541-561 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 20 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a marketing consultant, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (529 Mbps down, 546 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 509 Mbps down or 526 Mbps up. Most tests show 529+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 17 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly.

The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 23 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 23 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home.

I signed up for their 200 Mbps fiber service 4 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($50/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 200 Mbps, but I consistently get 236 Mbps download and 247 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 4 months, I've had exactly 0 outages. Zero downtime is incredible for any ISP. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10256,Google Reviews,2024-11-23,5,Andrew C.,Rural South Texas,"Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 3 months: After 3 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 228 Mbps down and 221 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 3 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1034 Mbps down and 1019 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (217 Mbps down, 219 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 197 Mbps down or 199 Mbps up. Most tests show 217+ Mbps in both directions.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 221-241 Mbps download and 216-236 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 16 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($70/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours.

He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call).

What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 8 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10267,Google Reviews,2024-11-19,4,Nicole D.,"Anaheim, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 3 months: After 3 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1026 Mbps down and 1037 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 3 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional.

10269,Yelp,2025-01-19,5,James K.,"Fort Worth, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 15 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 15 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1041 Mbps down, 1025 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1021 Mbps down or 1005 Mbps up. Most tests show 1041+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 15 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 15 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical).

10274,Google Reviews,2025-10-26,4,Tom S.,"San Antonio, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 20 months: After 20 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 544 Mbps down and 520 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 20 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 233-253 Mbps download and 249-269 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 10 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

She even recommended the 500 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 542 Mbps down and 548 Mbps up on my 500 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

10285,Trustpilot,2024-12-31,5,Emily E.,"San Antonio, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 3 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 3 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (546 Mbps down, 530 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 526 Mbps down or 510 Mbps up. Most tests show 546+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 3 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 3 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once for help with router settings. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",44,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/10285,Great Value for Money,True,True,False

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 231-251 Mbps download and 249-269 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 24 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10291,Trustpilot,2025-01-31,5,Michelle E.,"McKinney, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: After 13 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 241 Mbps down and 244 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 13 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10294,Yelp,2024-11-28,5,Joseph K.,"Los Angeles, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 11 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a video editor, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (248 Mbps down, 222 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 228 Mbps down or 202 Mbps up. Most tests show 248+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 11 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 11 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Small business owner working from home.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process.

10299,ConsumerAffairs,2025-03-21,5,Anthony O.,Rural West Texas,"Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 8 months: After 8 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1021 Mbps down and 1018 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 8 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1036 Mbps down and 1046 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a software developer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (534 Mbps down, 531 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 514 Mbps down or 511 Mbps up. Most tests show 534+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 4 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 4 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once for help with router settings. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try.

I signed up for their 200 Mbps fiber service 18 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($50/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 200 Mbps, but I consistently get 239 Mbps download and 217 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 18 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10308,Google Reviews,2025-06-10,5,Elizabeth E.,"Houston, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 15 months: After 15 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 216 Mbps down and 237 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 15 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10311,Yelp,2024-06-19,5,Ashley N.,Rural Central California,"Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 21 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 21 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 220-240 Mbps download and 220-240 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 21 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1034 Mbps down, 1044 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1014 Mbps down or 1024 Mbps up. Most tests show 1034+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 16 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 16 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",76,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/10312,Superior to Cable,False,False,False

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 249 Mbps down and 233 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10316,BBB,2025-07-18,5,Linda N.,"Anaheim, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 20 months: After 20 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1030 Mbps down and 1044 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 20 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($70/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics.

10319,BBB,2024-06-26,5,James H.,"Irvine, CA","Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 8 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 8 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 500 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 538-558 Mbps download and 540-560 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 8 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 21 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 21 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household.

10322,BBB,2025-04-10,5,Angela J.,"Glendale, CA","Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 6 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 6 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1036-1056 Mbps download and 1048-1068 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 6 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a software developer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (227 Mbps down, 215 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 207 Mbps down or 195 Mbps up. Most tests show 227+ Mbps in both directions.

I signed up for their 200 Mbps fiber service 8 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($50/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional.

He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 200 Mbps, but I consistently get 247 Mbps download and 228 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 8 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 23 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home.

10330,Yelp,2025-02-27,4,Amanda X.,"Dallas, TX","Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 24 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 24 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 500 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 525-545 Mbps download and 526-546 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 24 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

10331,ConsumerAffairs,2025-09-28,4,Patricia Q.,"Los Angeles, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 4 months: After 4 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 528 Mbps down and 539 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 4 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (525 Mbps down, 521 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 505 Mbps down or 501 Mbps up. Most tests show 525+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 9 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 9 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan.

I signed up for their 500 Mbps fiber service 11 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($70/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 500 Mbps, but I consistently get 539 Mbps download and 533 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 11 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1028 Mbps down, 1020 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1008 Mbps down or 1000 Mbps up. Most tests show 1028+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 6 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 6 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once for help with router settings. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",14,https://example.com/reviews/yelp/10338,Outstanding Experience,True,True,False
10339,Trustpilot,2024-09-23,4,Linda D.,"Santa Ana, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 11 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a software developer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (232 Mbps down, 230 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 212 Mbps down or 210 Mbps up. Most tests show 232+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth.

No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees).

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 223 Mbps down and 233 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 247-267 Mbps download and 230-250 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home.

10344,ConsumerAffairs,2025-10-25,5,Joshua B.,"San Antonio, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: After 13 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 229 Mbps down and 231 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 13 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

However, she was transparent about pricing ($50/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 200 Mbps, but I consistently get 233 Mbps download and 232 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 6 months, I've had exactly 0 outages. Zero downtime is incredible for any ISP. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10349,ConsumerAffairs,2024-06-23,5,Jason Y.,"Irving, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 7 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 7 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a software developer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (531 Mbps down, 522 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 511 Mbps down or 502 Mbps up. Most tests show 531+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 7 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 7 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Small business owner working from home.

10350,Trustpilot,2024-06-21,5,Matthew D.,"Irvine, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 21 months: After 21 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 543 Mbps down and 534 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 21 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1027-1047 Mbps download and 1025-1045 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 9 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team.

10361,Yelp,2025-09-08,5,Sarah T.,"El Paso, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 4 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 4 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1030 Mbps down, 1029 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1010 Mbps down or 1009 Mbps up. Most tests show 1030+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 4 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 4 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once for help with router settings. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices.

10362,Trustpilot,2024-07-01,5,Robert Z.,"Fresno, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: After 13 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 546 Mbps down and 527 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 13 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1038-1058 Mbps download and 1018-1038 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 9 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10367,BBB,2025-09-08,4,Jason S.,"McKinney, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 24 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 24 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (526 Mbps down, 516 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 506 Mbps down or 496 Mbps up. Most tests show 526+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 24 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 24 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home.

She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance.

10374,BBB,2024-10-15,5,Emily S.,"Fort Worth, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 20 months: After 20 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1015 Mbps down and 1015 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 20 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10375,Trustpilot,2025-08-05,5,Paul B.,"Glendale, CA","Network Performance Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 12 months: I need to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with Frontier Fiber. I signed up for their 500 Mbps fiber service 12 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($70/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 500 Mbps, but I consistently get 528 Mbps download and 518 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 12 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10376,BBB,2024-11-21,5,Patricia G.,"San Diego, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 14 months: After 14 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 521 Mbps down and 530 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 14 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10377,ConsumerAffairs,2024-11-21,5,Brian R.,"Anaheim, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 11 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a marketing consultant, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (243 Mbps down, 218 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 223 Mbps down or 198 Mbps up. Most tests show 243+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 11 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 11 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home.

I signed up for their 200 Mbps fiber service 5 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($50/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 200 Mbps, but I consistently get 225 Mbps download and 216 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 235 Mbps down and 230 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1029 Mbps down and 1049 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

10385,BBB,2025-02-22,5,John L.,"Glendale, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 13 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1032 Mbps down, 1032 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1012 Mbps down or 1012 Mbps up. Most tests show 1032+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 13 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 13 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Small business owner working from home.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1033-1053 Mbps download and 1015-1035 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 16 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours.

10395,Google Reviews,2025-08-25,4,Robert X.,"Houston, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 17 months: After 17 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 233 Mbps down and 240 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 17 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 500 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 532-552 Mbps download and 536-556 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 14 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (533 Mbps down, 543 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 513 Mbps down or 523 Mbps up. Most tests show 533+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 13 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 13 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",49,https://example.com/reviews/consumeraffairs/10404,Fantastic Fiber Internet,False,False,False
10405,BBB,2025-03-22,4,Chris F.,"Sacramento, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 16 months: After 16 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1017 Mbps down and 1021 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 16 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 500 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 518 Mbps down and 534 Mbps up on my 500 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 249-269 Mbps download and 238-258 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 20 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously.

I signed up for their 500 Mbps fiber service 17 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($70/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 500 Mbps, but I consistently get 523 Mbps download and 531 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 17 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10421,BBB,2024-07-05,4,Karen L.,"Long Beach, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 12 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 12 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1025 Mbps down, 1019 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1005 Mbps down or 999 Mbps up. Most tests show 1025+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 12 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 12 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical).

10422,Google Reviews,2025-02-26,5,Linda O.,"Santa Ana, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 7 months: After 7 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1044 Mbps down and 1040 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 7 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it.

He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password.

Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1037-1057 Mbps download and 1040-1060 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1048 Mbps down and 1049 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 20 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1022 Mbps download and 1023 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 20 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10427,Google Reviews,2025-08-24,5,Ashley V.,"Santa Ana, CA","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 10 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 10 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a marketing consultant, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (226 Mbps down, 216 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 206 Mbps down or 196 Mbps up. Most tests show 226+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 10 months, I've had zero outages. Zero downtime is remarkable for any ISP and speaks to the quality of their fiber infrastructure. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 10 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",0,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/10427,Fantastic Fiber Internet,True,False,False

I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1036 Mbps down and 1028 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 12 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 500 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 534-554 Mbps download and 521-541 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 15 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",20,https://example.com/reviews/googlereviews/10433,Exceeded My Expectations,True,False,True
10434,Google Reviews,2025-01-30,5,John M.,"Irving, TX","Customer Service Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 14 months: I've been a Frontier Fiber customer for 14 months and I feel compelled to write this review because their customer service has consistently exceeded my expectations. My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 500 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 542 Mbps down and 529 Mbps up on my 500 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10435,BBB,2024-09-11,4,Brian W.,"Dallas, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 24 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 24 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (536 Mbps down, 517 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 516 Mbps down or 497 Mbps up. Most tests show 536+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 24 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 24 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Work from home part-time (important).

10439,Trustpilot,2025-06-03,5,Rebecca I.,"San Francisco, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 24 months: After 24 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 239 Mbps down and 241 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 24 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price.

I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 7 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1042 Mbps download and 1015 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 7 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (500 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 500 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 535-555 Mbps download and 523-543 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 21 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 500 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 523 Mbps down and 524 Mbps up on my 500 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

10447,Google Reviews,2025-01-03,5,Michael J.,"El Paso, TX","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 8 months: After 8 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 217 Mbps down and 233 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 8 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price.

10448,ConsumerAffairs,2024-11-17,5,Jessica S.,"San Antonio, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 15 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 15 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a graphic designer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (246 Mbps down, 224 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 226 Mbps down or 204 Mbps up. Most tests show 246+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 15 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 15 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Small business owner working from home.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 1047 Mbps down and 1044 Mbps up on my 1000 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues.

10453,Google Reviews,2025-01-24,5,Michael Q.,Rural Southern California,"Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 6 months: After 6 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 200 Mbps fiber plan was $50/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $50 + $4 in taxes/fees = $54 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 200 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 240 Mbps down and 218 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 6 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.1 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Small business owner working from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10455,ConsumerAffairs,2025-04-16,5,Thomas O.,"Long Beach, CA","Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 3 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 3 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1030-1050 Mbps download and 1020-1040 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 3 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 20 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1023 Mbps download and 1037 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 20 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10457,ConsumerAffairs,2024-06-16,5,Joshua D.,Rural Central California,"Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 21 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 21 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a data analyst, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 500 Mbps plan at $70/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (532 Mbps down, 521 Mbps up - exceeding the 500 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 512 Mbps down or 501 Mbps up. Most tests show 532+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 21 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 21 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $74 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Small business owner working from home.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing. When the maintenance was completed, I got another email confirming everything was done and thanking me for my patience. The speeds have been consistently excellent - I get 248 Mbps down and 247 Mbps up on my 200 Mbps plan. The fiber service itself has been rock solid with no issues. But what really sets Frontier apart is how they treat customers. I've dealt with multiple ISPs over the years, and Frontier's customer service is head and shoulders above the rest.

10463,ConsumerAffairs,2024-07-25,4,Joshua V.,"McKinney, TX","Installation & Setup Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: I want to share my exceptional installation experience with Frontier Fiber because it set the tone for what has been 11 months of outstanding service. I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (200 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 200 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 234-254 Mbps download and 239-259 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 2000 square foot home. I've had zero service interruptions in 11 months. Working from home has been seamless with video calls, large file transfers, and multiple devices connected simultaneously. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10466,BBB,2025-04-11,5,Michelle V.,"Fresno, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 11 months: After 11 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 1000 Mbps fiber plan was $85/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $85 + $4 in taxes/fees = $89 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 1000 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 1031 Mbps down and 1042 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 11 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.09 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $40 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $480 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

10467,ConsumerAffairs,2025-03-30,5,Susan N.,"Arlington, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 18 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 18 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a software developer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 2 kids who use the internet heavily for work and entertainment. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 200 Mbps plan at $50/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (228 Mbps down, 230 Mbps up - exceeding the 200 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 208 Mbps down or 210 Mbps up. Most tests show 228+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 18 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support twice in 18 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $54 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 500 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive.

I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes.

10473,Google Reviews,2024-10-26,4,Thomas O.,"Fremont, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 16 months: After 16 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 528 Mbps down and 545 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 16 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Work from home full-time (mission critical). Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($50/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 200 Mbps, but I consistently get 226 Mbps download and 236 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 17 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed.

He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose.

He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team.

When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1050 Mbps download and 1045 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 22 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops.

10486,BBB,2025-01-27,5,Angela L.,"Long Beach, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 23 months: After 23 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 547 Mbps down and 537 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 23 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Multiple family members working/studying from home. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.

I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a software developer, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have elderly parents living with us who use the internet heavily for online school and gaming. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1019 Mbps down, 1023 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 999 Mbps down or 1003 Mbps up. Most tests show 1019+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 13 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 13 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try.

10491,ConsumerAffairs,2025-09-26,5,Michelle V.,"Long Beach, CA","Customer Service Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 17 months: I've been a Frontier Fiber customer for 17 months and I feel compelled to write this review because their customer service has consistently exceeded my expectations. My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 1000 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too.

I signed up for their 1000 Mbps fiber service 15 months ago after years of frustration with cable internet from my previous provider. The difference has been night and day. When the Frontier sales rep came to my door, I was skeptical because I'd heard mixed reviews about ISPs in general. However, she was transparent about pricing ($85/month with no price increases for 2 years), explained the installation process clearly, and answered all my questions without any high-pressure sales tactics. I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. Installation was scheduled within a week. The technician called 30 minutes before arrival (within my scheduled 8am-12pm window), showed up at 9:15am, and was incredibly professional. He walked me through where he'd run the fiber line, asked my preference for router placement, and completed the installation in about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber underground to my house, drilled a clean hole through the exterior wall, and mounted everything neatly in my network closet. He tested everything thoroughly, showed me how to access the router settings, and gave me his direct number in case I had any issues in the first week (I never needed to call). The speeds have been phenomenal from day one. I'm paying for 1000 Mbps, but I consistently get 1019 Mbps download and 1038 Mbps upload on speed tests. What's even more impressive is that these speeds are consistent 24/7 - no slowdowns during evening peak hours like I experienced with cable. I work from home as a software engineer, so I'm downloading large code repositories, uploading builds to cloud servers, and on video calls constantly throughout the day. Frontier's symmetrical speeds (fast upload AND download) have been a game changer for my productivity. The network reliability has been outstanding. In 15 months, I've had exactly 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe thunderstorm, lasted only 25 minutes, and I received a proactive email from Frontier explaining the issue before I even noticed. The latency is excellent - I consistently get 3-5ms ping to local servers and 15-20ms to distant servers. This makes video calls crystal clear with no lag, and my kids who game online haven't experienced any lag or connection drops. I'm on video calls 4-6 hours per day, and colleagues have commented on how clear my video and audio are. The fiber connection just works reliably, day after day.

10493,Trustpilot,2025-05-02,4,Richard G.,"Houston, TX","Overall Satisfaction (Primary) - Customer for 13 months: I'm writing this comprehensive review after 13 months as a Frontier Fiber customer because my experience has been so positive across every aspect of their service. I want to share the details because I know how hard it is to find honest, detailed ISP reviews. Background: I work from home full-time as a marketing consultant, so reliable internet isn't just convenient - it's mission critical for my livelihood. My spouse also works from home part-time, and we have 3 kids who use the internet heavily for streaming and video calls. Needless to say, our household puts serious demands on our internet connection. Before Frontier, I was with a major cable ISP for 6 years. The service was okay but not great - speeds were inconsistent, there were frequent brief outages, and the price kept increasing annually. When I saw Frontier was installing fiber in my neighborhood, I researched extensively. The reviews were mixed (as they are for any ISP), but the technology (fiber vs cable) and pricing made me decide to give them a shot. SALES & SIGN-UP PROCESS: The Frontier sales rep who came to my door was professional and transparent. She explained exactly what speeds were available in my area, the pricing structure with 2-year price lock, and the installation process. She didn't use high-pressure tactics or make unrealistic promises. I signed up for the 1000 Mbps plan at $85/month. INSTALLATION: Scheduled within 5 days of signing up. I got email and text confirmations with my installation window (8am-12pm). The technician arrived at 9:30am, right in the middle of my window. He was professional, explained what he'd be doing, and asked my preferences for router placement. Installation took about 2.5 hours. He ran the fiber line underground (not across my yard), drilled a small, clean hole for the entry point, and mounted everything neatly in my utility closet. He tested the connection thoroughly, showed me the speed test results (1035 Mbps down, 1047 Mbps up - exceeding the 1000 Mbps I'm paying for), helped me set up my WiFi network, and even helped connect some of my smart home devices. He cleaned up everything and left no mess. NETWORK PERFORMANCE: This is where Frontier really shines. The speeds are consistently excellent. I run speed tests weekly just to track performance, and I've never seen my speeds drop below 1015 Mbps down or 1027 Mbps up. Most tests show 1035+ Mbps in both directions. What's impressive is the consistency - 8am or 8pm, Monday or Saturday, the speeds are always maxed out. No peak-hour slowdowns. The symmetrical speeds (equal download and upload) have been transformative for working from home. Video calls are crisp with no lag. Uploading work files is fast. Screen sharing is smooth. I can run a video call while my spouse is on a separate call and the kids are streaming, and everything works without any buffering or quality drops. The latency is excellent - I get 3-6ms ping to local servers, which is perfect for real-time applications. RELIABILITY: In 13 months, I've had only 1 brief outage. That one outage was during a severe storm with lightning in our immediate area, lasted only 20 minutes, and Frontier sent a proactive email explaining the situation before I even reported it. My previous cable ISP had outages monthly. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've contacted Frontier support three times in 13 months - once with a billing question, once to change my billing date, and once when I was considering upgrading my plan. Each time, wait times were under 10 minutes, and the representatives were knowledgeable, friendly, and actually solved my issues on the first contact. No transfers, no callbacks that never came, no reading from scripts - just genuine help. BILLING & VALUE: My bill is consistent every month - $89 (base price plus taxes/fees). No surprise charges, no price increases after a promo period, no equipment rental fees. It's refreshing to have transparent, predictable billing. The value is excellent - I'm paying less than I did for cable internet while getting significantly faster speeds and better reliability. OVERALL: Every aspect of my Frontier experience has been positive. Professional installation, excellent network performance, reliable service, helpful customer service, and fair pricing. It's rare to be genuinely satisfied with an ISP, but Frontier has earned my loyalty and my recommendation. If Frontier Fiber is available in your area and you're considering switching, I highly recommend giving them a try. The fiber technology is superior to cable, the pricing is competitive, and in my experience, they deliver on their promises. Use Case: Family with multiple users and devices. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve. Churn Risk: Low - Very satisfied, planning to stay long-term.",23,https://example.com/reviews/trustpilot/10493,,False,False,False

I scheduled my installation online, and the process was straightforward - I picked my plan (1000 Mbps fiber), selected an installation date from available options, and chose a 4-hour window (8am-12pm). I received immediate email confirmation with details about what to expect. Two days before installation, I got a reminder email. The day before, I received a text message with my technician's name and estimated arrival time. On installation day, the technician (Mike) called me at 8:45am to let me know he'd be at my house around 9:15am. He arrived at 9:10am - early and ready to work. Mike was professional, friendly, and clearly very experienced. He walked around my house first to assess the best fiber line route. He showed me three options for how to run the fiber from the street to my house, explained the pros and cons of each, and let me choose. I picked the option that was slightly more work for him but would be least visible - he didn't complain or try to talk me out of it. He ran the fiber line underground from the utility pole, which took about 90 minutes. He trenched carefully, staying clear of my sprinkler system and landscaping. He drilled a small, clean hole through my exterior wall into my network closet (exactly where I wanted the router). Inside, he mounted the ONT (optical network terminal) neatly on the wall, connected the router, and organized all cables with proper cable management. He didn't just leave wires hanging everywhere like some installers do. After the physical installation, Mike tested everything thoroughly. He ran multiple speed tests from different devices, checked WiFi coverage in various rooms of my house, and helped me set up a custom WiFi network name and password. He showed me how to access the router admin panel, explained the different settings, and gave me tips for optimizing WiFi performance. He even helped me connect my smart home devices (thermostat, security cameras, smart TV) to the new network. The whole installation took about 3 hours, and Mike was meticulous about cleaning up afterwards. He filled in the trench, restored the grass, and didn't leave any trash or debris. Before leaving, he gave me his direct number and said to call if I had any issues in the first week. He also explained that Frontier would call me in a few days to make sure everything was working well. Sure enough, 3 days later, I got a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team. They asked if the installation went smoothly, if I was satisfied with the speeds, and if I had any questions. It felt like they genuinely cared about my experience. The 1000 Mbps fiber service has been perfect since day one. I consistently get 1032-1052 Mbps download and 1043-1063 Mbps upload. The WiFi coverage reaches every corner of my 3000 square foot home.

My journey started when I called to ask about availability in my area. The sales rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, patient with all my questions, and didn't use any high-pressure tactics. She explained exactly what speeds were available, the pricing structure, installation process, and contract terms. She even recommended the 200 Mbps plan instead of the 1 Gig plan I was considering, saying it would be perfect for my household size and save me $15/month. That kind of honesty built immediate trust. The installation was scheduled for the following Tuesday. I received confirmation emails and text messages with the technician's estimated arrival time. He arrived right on schedule, was professional and friendly, and took time to explain everything he was doing. After installation, I received a follow-up call from Frontier's customer care team asking if everything was working well and if I had any questions. That proactive outreach was impressive. About 3 months into my service, I had a question about my bill (just wanted to understand a line item - turned out it was the taxes/fees breakdown). I called customer support expecting a long hold time, but was connected to a representative in under 5 minutes. She was extremely helpful, pulled up my account immediately, explained the charges clearly, and even looked for ways to save me money. She found a promotion I qualified for that reduced my bill by $10/month and applied it right there on the call. The whole interaction took maybe 10 minutes and left me feeling valued as a customer. I also had to change my billing date once due to a change in my pay schedule. I used their online chat feature, and within 3 minutes, the agent had made the change and confirmed it would take effect next billing cycle. No hassle, no runaround, just efficient service. The proactive communication has been excellent too. When there was planned maintenance in my area, I received an email 5 days in advance explaining the maintenance window (2am-5am, so it didn't affect me) and what they'd be doing.

10499,Trustpilot,2025-06-22,4,Laura F.,"Santa Ana, CA","Value & Pricing Excellence (Primary) - Customer for 12 months: After 12 months with Frontier Fiber, I need to share why this is the best value in internet service I've found. I was previously paying my old cable ISP $115/month for 300 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload (and those were best-case speeds - reality was usually 180 Mbps down and 8 Mbps up during peak hours). When Frontier became available in my neighborhood, I did my research. Their 500 Mbps fiber plan was $70/month with a 2-year price lock guarantee - meaning no surprise price increases after a promo period ends. I was skeptical because ISPs are notorious for advertising low prices that balloon after 12 months, but Frontier was very transparent. The contract clearly stated my price for 24 months, and it listed all fees upfront - just taxes and a small regulatory fee (about $4/month total). No equipment rental fees because the router is included. No installation fee. No activation fee. No surprise charges. I've been tracking my bills carefully, and every month has been exactly $70 + $4 in taxes/fees = $74 total. Consistent and predictable, which I really appreciate for budgeting. But value isn't just about price - it's about what you get for that price. And the value proposition with Frontier is incredible. I'm getting true fiber internet with symmetrical speeds - 500 Mbps both download AND upload. Not advertised speeds that are actually ""up to"" speeds that you never actually achieve. I run speed tests regularly (I'm a data nerd), and I consistently get 549 Mbps down and 532 Mbps up. During peak evening hours (7pm-10pm when everyone is streaming), my speeds remain maxed out. No throttling, no congestion, just consistent performance. The symmetrical upload speed has been a game-changer. With cable internet, I had fast downloads but terrible upload speeds. Uploading work files to cloud storage, video calls, or backing up photos took forever. With Frontier's fiber, uploads are just as fast as downloads. I can upload a 5GB file in under 2 minutes. Video calls are crystal clear because of the high upload bandwidth. The network has been incredibly reliable - I've had zero outages in 12 months (compared to monthly outages with my previous ISP). No data caps either, which is huge. My household streams 4K video, games online, works from home, and we use hundreds of GB per month without any throttling or overage fees. When I calculate the value, I'm paying about $0.14 per Mbps of bandwidth, and getting rock-solid reliability. My previous cable ISP was $0.38 per Mbps with frequent issues. Plus, I'm saving $30 per month compared to what I was paying before. Over a year, that's $360 in savings while getting better service. Installation was free and professional. Customer service has been helpful the few times I've contacted them. Billing is transparent and consistent. The technology (fiber to the home) is future-proof and will serve me well for years. For anyone comparing ISPs, I can't recommend Frontier Fiber highly enough. The value proposition is unbeatable - you're getting premium fiber internet at a very reasonable price. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, just excellent service at a fair price. Use Case: Heavy streaming and gaming household. Resolution Status: No issues to resolve.
