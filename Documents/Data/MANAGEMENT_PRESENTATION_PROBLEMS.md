### PROBLEM #2: NETWORK PERFORMANCE & INFRASTRUCTURE OVERSELLING
**📈 Prevalence: 1,396 reviews (27.9% of all reviews)**

- Direct impact on work-from-home customers (mission-critical use case)

#### Key Issues Identified:
1. **Speed Inconsistencies**

- **Customer Frustration**: Service issues + poor support = extreme dissatisfaction
- **Reputation Damage**: "Worst customer service ever" language in reviews

#### What to Show Management:
- **Sample Quote**: *"Spent 2 hours on hold, got transferred 5 times, problem still not fixed. Worst customer service ever."*
- **Operational Cost**: If average support call costs $15 and customers call 8 times = **$120 per issue** (vs. $15 if resolved first time)
