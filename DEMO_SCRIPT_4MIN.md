### **Opening (15 seconds)**

**[Start on Main Dashboard - app/]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "Welcome to Nimbus AI - an intelligent customer sentiment analytics platform that transforms thousands of customer reviews into actionable insights. Instead of manually reading through reviews, Nimbus uses Claude AI to automatically extract sentiment, identify churn risk, and surface critical issues in real-time."

### **KPI Cards Overview (20 seconds)**

**[Gesture to the 4 KPI cards at the top]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "At a glance, we can see our key metrics. Here we're analyzing 5,000 reviews with an average rating of 1.9 out of 5 - telling us we have serious problems. The average sentiment score is negative at -0.45, and most critically, 70% of our reviews indicate high churn risk. This means the majority of these customers are likely to leave if we don't take action."

**HIGHLIGHT:**

### **Charts - Focus on "Sentiment Trend Over Time" (30 seconds)**

**[Point to the "Sentiment Trend Over Time" line chart]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "Looking at our Sentiment Trend Over Time, we can see customer sentiment declining from January to November 2024. This declining trend tells us that whatever problems existed at the start of the year are getting worse, not better. 

> Notice how the dashboard also shows us Reviews Over Time with daily, weekly, or monthly granularity - helping us correlate volume spikes with sentiment changes. And our Churn Risk Distribution shows us exactly how many customers fall into each risk category - giving us a clear picture of who needs immediate attention."

**HIGHLIGHT:**
- **Sentiment Trend**: Declining line from positive to negative territory
- **Reviews Over Time**: Toggle between day/week/month views (show the buttons)
