# Nimbus AI - Click & Say Demo Script

## Simple Step-by-Step Demo Guide (4 Minutes)

---

## 🎬 SCENE 1: MAIN DASHBOARD (90 seconds)

### **START: Main Dashboard Page (localhost:3000)**

**SAY:**
> "Welcome to Nimbus AI - we transform thousands of customer reviews into actionable insights using Claude AI, automatically extracting sentiment, identifying churn risk, and surfacing critical issues."

---

**POINT TO: Top 4 KPI Cards**

**SAY:**
> "At a glance: 5,000 reviews analyzed, average rating 1.9 out of 5, negative sentiment at -0.45, and critically - 70% high churn risk, meaning most customers are likely to leave without intervention."

---

**POINT TO: "Sentiment Trend Over Time" chart (green line)**

**SAY:**
> "Here's sentiment declining from January to November - problems are getting worse, not better. The dashboard shows reviews over time with daily, weekly, or monthly views, and churn risk distribution by category."

**HOVER OVER: Daily/Weekly/Monthly buttons**

---

**POINT TO: Pie charts and Recent Reviews table**

**SAY:**
> "Below: sentiment distribution, category breakdown - billing, network, customer service - all automatically classified. Recent Reviews table lets us drill into specifics."

---

**SAY:**
> "This dashboard gives executives instant visibility into customer health. Now let's drill deeper into the reviews."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 2: REVIEWS & DETAIL (90 seconds)

**CLICK: "Reviews" in sidebar**

**SAY:**
> "The Reviews section - searchable, filterable, sortable. Full database at your fingertips."

---

**CLICK: Any review in the table to open detail page**

**SAY:**
> "Drilling into a specific review - here's where Nimbus really shines."

---

**POINT TO: Left card (Basic Information)**
**POINT TO: Right card (AI Analysis)**

**SAY:**
> "Left: basic info - date, platform, rating, location. Right: AI-powered analysis - sentiment score, churn risk with probability, category, NPS indicator, urgency level - all automatically extracted by Claude."

---

**SCROLL TO: Review Text section**

**CLICK: Blue "AI Summary" button**

**WAIT: For modal to appear**

**SAY:**
> "Rather than reading lengthy reviews, click AI Summary for an instant concise summary. Claude distills this into key points - main complaint, customer emotion, core issues. This scales to thousands of reviews effortlessly."

---

**CLICK: Close modal (X button)**

**CLICK: Purple/Indigo "Ask a Question" button**

**TYPE: "What specific billing issues did this customer experience?"**

**CLICK: "Ask Question" button**

**WAIT: For AI answer to appear**

**SAY:**
> "Even better - ask specific questions about any review. I asked 'What specific billing issues did this customer experience?' and Claude extracts the exact answer: hidden equipment fees, broadcast TV surcharges, promotional rates that doubled. Natural language Q&A turns reviews into queryable knowledge - find any detail instantly without re-reading."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 3: AI CHAT (60 seconds)

**CLICK: "AI Chat" in sidebar**

**SAY:**
> "Now the most powerful feature - AI Chat."

---

**POINT TO: Chat interface and input field**

**SAY:**
> "Business users ask questions about the entire dataset in natural language. No SQL, no technical skills. Just ask like you would a colleague."

---

**TYPE IN INPUT FIELD: "What are the top 3 customer complaints causing high churn risk?"**

**CLICK: Send button (or press Enter)**

**WAIT: For AI response**

**SAY:**
> "Asking 'What are the top 3 complaints causing high churn risk?' Claude analyzes all 5,000 reviews and responds: One - hidden fees and billing affecting 44% of reviews. Two - network performance issues affecting 28%. Three - poor customer service affecting 13%."

---

**POINT TO: Sources panel on right side**

**SAY:**
> "Notice the sources panel - Claude shows the actual reviews used to generate this answer, with IDs, dates, sentiment, churn risk, and snippets. Every answer is backed by citations. Full transparency and traceability. Click any source to view the full review."

---

**SAY (without clicking):**
> "I can ask anything: 'Which states have network problems?' 'What action items should we prioritize?' 'Are issues improving over time?' Semantic search understands meaning, not just keywords - finds insights even in vague language."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 4: CLOSING (30 seconds)

**SAY:**
> "So that's Nimbus AI. Let me recap the value:

> First - we automatically analyze thousands of reviews using Claude AI, extracting sentiment, identifying churn risk, categorizing issues - no manual work.

> Second - we surface actionable insights through an intuitive dashboard, giving executives instant visibility into customer health, trends, and risk.
