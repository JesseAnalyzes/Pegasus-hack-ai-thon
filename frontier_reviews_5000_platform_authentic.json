    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $56/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 16 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $56 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $51/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $102/month - over a 118% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 59 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 66% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 32 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $218 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $110 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $245 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber 6 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (Xfinity) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 12 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 500 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $61/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 200 Mbps, other times dropping to 26 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 7 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $30 to $98 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address & honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $137 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 200 Mbps, other times dropping to 31 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 5 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $41 to $129 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $96 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $261 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 14 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $50/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $106/month - over a 115% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 69 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 38 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $392 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $87 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $184 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $72/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $103 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $72 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I've been dealing with Frontier for 6 months now and it's been frustrating. The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 1000 Mbps, other times dropping to 21 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 6 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $39 to $108 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $61 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $180 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $55/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $97 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $55 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $84/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $90 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 16 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $84 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service... Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $79 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $287 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $52/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $113 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $52 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself.

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $106/month - over a 126% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 37 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 69% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 45 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $345 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $69 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $277 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 10 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $53/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $133 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $36/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $126/month - over a 140% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 49 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 65% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 31 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $378 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $75/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $116 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $75 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago i called to cancel my service because i was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $75 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $218 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 10 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $77/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $92 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $305 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $53/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $98 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 9 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $53 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

I signed up for Frontier 7 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $93/month - over a 92% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $15 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 92 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 49% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 33 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 10 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $333 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 2500 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $160. Service works okay but not worth the hassle. Support is slow to respond and unhelpful. Been with them 8 months and counting down until contract ends. Installation quality was unprofessional and the equipment is subpar.

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $128/month - over a 104% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 82 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 39% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 16 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $279 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $90/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $119 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $90 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $59/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $138 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher.

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago i called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $104 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $322 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 16 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $48/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $110/month - over a 150% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $22 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 79 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 37% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 25 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $257 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $97 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Equipment rental (${equip}/mo), broadcast fee (${tv}/mo), regional sports fee (${sports}/mo) - I don't even have TV! Called to complain and they basically said tough luck, it's in the fine print. Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 4 outages in two months. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 8 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $84 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $325 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $57/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $140 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $57 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $77 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $297 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $106 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $82 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber 10 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (AT&T) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 10 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $68/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $60 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $326 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $106/month - over a 122% increase!! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $16/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 85 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 20 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $381 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $38 to $125 per month with no warning.

    "review_text": "I've been dealing with Frontier for 5 months now and it's been frustrating. The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 100 Mbps, other times dropping to 35 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 5 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $34 to $96 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 11 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $86/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $75 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $284 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $108 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $189 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $43/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $105/month - over a 137% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 39% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 38 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $362 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $80/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber 18 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (AT&T) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 15 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $80/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 12 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $48/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 105% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 53 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 48% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 35 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $243 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $86/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $133 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $86 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 200 Mbps, other times dropping to 31 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 6 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $47 to $93 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $103 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $267 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $110 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $101 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $294 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Equipment rental (${equip}/mo), broadcast fee (${tv}/mo), regional sports fee (${sports}/mo) - I don't even have TV! Called to complain and they basically said tough luck, it's in the fine print. Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 3 outages in the last three months. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 4 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $63/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $110 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $63 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1500 sq ft home.

Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $56 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $83/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $106 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files.

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $82/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 4 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $57/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $68/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $134 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $68 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 1000 Mbps, other times dropping to 29 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 8 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $45 to $90 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, & returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $72 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing & they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $228 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April!

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $65 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $290 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office.

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 14 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $54/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $93/month - over a 116% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 82 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 54% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 26 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $254 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $53/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $123 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $53 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $85/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $112 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $85 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 6 outages in the last three months. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 8 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 14 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $114/month - over a 85% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $10 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 66 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 69% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 28 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $358 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "Had Frontier for 9 months in San Diego and it's been excellent. The 100 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $63/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from Comcast where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $36/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $97/month - over a 80% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $25/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $15 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 77 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 61% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 45 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $232 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $109 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 5 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $83/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 2000 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $200. Service works okay but not worth the hassle. Support is slow to respond and unhelpful. Been with them 6 months and counting down until contract ends. Installation quality was unprofessional and the equipment is subpar.

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address & honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $51/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $125 I was paying AT&T for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 14 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $51 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $94 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $234 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 17 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $73/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 8 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $122/month - over a 138% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 79 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 45 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $387 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $74/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $108 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $74 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Had Frontier for 16 months in Houston and it's been excellent. The 1000 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $73/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1200 sq ft home. Coming from Cox where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

Install took 4 hours and left cables running across my ceiling in the ugliest way possible. Asked about running them through walls, was told that costs extra. The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 1800 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $142. Service works okay but not worth the hassle. Support is slow to respond and unhelpful. Been with them 6 months and counting down until contract ends. Installation quality was unprofessional and the equipment is subpar. Would give zero stars if I could.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 5 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $44/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $117/month - over a 101% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $17 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 68 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 56% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 44 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $319 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $63/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $121 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $63 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 3 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $89/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 1000 Mbps, other times dropping to 30 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 8 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $46 to $130 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $52/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $130 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $52 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 14 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $67/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $53 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 100 Mbps, other times dropping to 13 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 5 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $50 to $96 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $81 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $288 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 16 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $44/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $118/month - over a 143% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 92 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 65% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 38 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $282 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $83/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $105 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $83 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $70 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $273 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 5 outages in six weeks. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 7 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $87/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $111 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $87 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber 8 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (Xfinity) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 14 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $79/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure i was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself.

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 17 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $52/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $109/month - over a 142% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 78 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 29 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $260 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $52/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $94 I was paying Spectrum for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 8 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $52 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $55/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time.

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $59/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $133 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $59 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 1800 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $186. Service works okay but not worth the hassle. Support is slow to respond and unhelpful. Been with them 8 months and counting down until contract ends. Installation quality was unprofessional and the equipment is subpar.

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $106 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $247 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $36/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $117/month - over a 94% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $10 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 39 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 59% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 36 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $300 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $52/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 17 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $115/month - over a 105% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 52 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 45% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 18 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 4 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $283 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $69 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $244 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $123 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $82 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 11 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $64/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 12 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $55/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $130/month - over a 132% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $20 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 86 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 53% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 37 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $381 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $78 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $321 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Bill has stayed at $74/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 2000 sq ft home. Coming from Comcast where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $52/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $52 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 10 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $86/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $86 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $183 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household.. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 14 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $51/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $94 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $51 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 200 Mbps, other times dropping to 37 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 6 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $46 to $93 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $114/month - over a 113% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $21/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $20 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 73 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 63% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 29 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $360 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $61/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from Spectrum where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $122/month - over a 147% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 54 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 39% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 18 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $229 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $46 to $112 per month with no warning.

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $80 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $313 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Customer service is terrible - I've called 6 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $50 to $95 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "Had Frontier for 18 months in Austin and it's been excellent. The 200 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $90/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 2000 sq ft home. Coming from AT&T where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $65 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $207 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 17 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $76/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $53/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $115 I was paying AT&T for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $53 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $60 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $241 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $49/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $97/month - over a 150% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 42 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 37% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 22 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $229 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $77/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $51/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $120 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $51 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $46/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $117/month - over a 99% increase!!! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $22 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 84 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 35% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 18 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $372 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $139 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 18 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $51/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $103/month - over a 108% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $15/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 52 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 41% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 17 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $226 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $81/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $62/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from Spectrum where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $56/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $97 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $56 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber 8 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (Cox) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 17 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $59/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $76/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $114 I was paying Spectrum for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $76 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $110/month - over a 135% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $22 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 54 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 35% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 37 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $201 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 12 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $114/month - over a 114% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 75 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 38% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 40 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $281 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $55/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $95 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $55 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 10 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $65/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 12 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $110/month - over a 131% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 43 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 56% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 28 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $270 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 18 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $53/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $124/month - over a 148% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $16 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 88 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 61% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 21 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $374 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service.. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, & returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $88 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $263 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 1000 Mbps, other times dropping to 11 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 4 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $36 to $92 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $65 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $277 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $69/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $134 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $69 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $73 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $308 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Coming from Xfinity where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $86 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $280 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $54/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $103 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $54 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 14 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $46/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $105/month - over a 93% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 34 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 44% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 28 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $356 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $53/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time.

Equipment rental (${equip}/mo), broadcast fee (${tv}/mo), regional sports fee (${sports}/mo) - I don't even have TV! Called to complain and they basically said tough luck, it's in the fine print. Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 3 outages in two months. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 8 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $85 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $238 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

The 200 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $52/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from AT&T where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $66 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $315 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address & honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $69/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $128 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $69 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $48 to $107 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $94 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $308 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $83/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time.

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $40/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $116/month - over a 99% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 42 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 59% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 17 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $290 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $81/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $108 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $81 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $91 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $256 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $60/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 8 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $60 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $296 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $98/month - over a 81% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 92 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 66% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 23 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $397 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I've been dealing with Frontier for 14 months now and it's been frustrating. The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 200 Mbps, other times dropping to 24 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 5 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $31 to $115 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $58/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $113 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $58 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 3 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $70/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 15 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $54/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $75 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $304 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $75/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $96 I was paying AT&T for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $75 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 500 Mbps, other times dropping to 32 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 8 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $42 to $123 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $66/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $107 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $66 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $84/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time.

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $54/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $95/month - over a 141% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $20 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 66 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 46% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 31 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $246 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from AT&T where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 8 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $115/month - over a 131% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 66 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 62% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 43 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 4 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $367 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $64/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $139 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 16 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $64 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Customer service is terrible - I've called 4 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $33 to $111 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $83/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 8 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $55/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $102/month - over a 120% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $21/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 43 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 58% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 35 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $316 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $77 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $256 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $81/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $48/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 133% increase!! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 60 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 64% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 32 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 4 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $215 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $56/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $119 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $56 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $56/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $116 I was paying AT&T for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $56 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 16 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $51/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $100/month - over a 103% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $12 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 92 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 60% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 18 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 4 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas?

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 8 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $81/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $92 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $232 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address & honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $69/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $113 I was paying AT&T for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $69 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $136 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 13 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $68/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 500 Mbps, other times dropping to 25 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 8 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $44 to $127 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 5 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $35/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 104% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 41 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 53% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 44 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 10 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $330 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $85 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $223 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $257 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $85/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $98 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $85 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 5 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $130/month - over a 114% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 78 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 48% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 21 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $227 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $80/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $128 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $80 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 17 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $46/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $112/month - over a 88% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 32 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 45% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 45 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $382 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $66 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $322 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 17 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $82 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 14 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $43/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $106/month - over a 145% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $17 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 60 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 44% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 36 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $342 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Equipment rental (${equip}/mo), broadcast fee (${tv}/mo), regional sports fee (${sports}/mo) - I don't even have TV! Called to complain and they basically said tough luck, it's in the fine print. Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 8 outages in the last three months. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 2 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 200 Mbps, other times dropping to 19 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours.

The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $37 to $96 per month with no warning.

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $81 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $330 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $66/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

Equipment rental (${equip}/mo), broadcast fee (${tv}/mo), regional sports fee (${sports}/mo) - I don't even have TV! Called to complain and they basically said tough luck, it's in the fine print. Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 7 outages in the last three months. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 5 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $92 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 9 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $82 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service.. Three months ago I called 2 cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $110 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $206 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 100 Mbps, other times dropping to 26 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 4 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $34 to $109 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 10 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $85/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $74 every single month on my credit card!! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $244 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $107 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $296 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

The 500 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $65/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from Comcast where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $40 to $111 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $139 I was paying Spectrum for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $129/month - over a 149% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 69 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 57% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 40 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $339 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 1200 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $151. Service works okay but not worth the hassle.

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber a year ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (AT&T) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 12 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $78/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $79/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $128 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $79 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $85 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $219 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $49/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $111/month - over a 109% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 70 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 64% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 20 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $237 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $71/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $112 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $71 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $75/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber 18 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (Xfinity) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 17 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $55/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 200 Mbps, other times dropping to 33 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 6 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $50 to $106 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

The 200 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $60/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from Comcast where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $55/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $60 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $216 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $43/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $113/month - over a 149% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 48 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 51% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 22 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $363 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $36/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $106/month - over a 133% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 44 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 43% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 17 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $267 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 200 Mbps, other times dropping to 11 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 3 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $39 to $123 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $81/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $90 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $81 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $67/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $114 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 14 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $67 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $100 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $208 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $60/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Xfinity for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $60 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $53/month with 'no hidden fees..' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $97/month - over a 86% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), & $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 79 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 61% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 33 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $277 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $57/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 2000 sq ft home. Coming from Xfinity where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $108 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $322 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $73/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $51/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $113/month - over a 81% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 71 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 47% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 19 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $324 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I've been dealing with Frontier for 5 months now and it's been frustrating. The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 500 Mbps, other times dropping to 14 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 6 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $32 to $105 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $85/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 2000 sq ft home. Coming from Comcast where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $96/month - over a 92% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 60% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 31 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $260 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 12 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 500 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $83/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $76 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $258 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do i even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $46/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $106/month - over a 116% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 70 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 65% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 37 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $281 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $79 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $294 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $68/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $128 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 10 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $68 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $59/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $96 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 9 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $59 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 1800 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $115. Service works okay but not worth the hassle. Support is slow to respond and unhelpful. Been with them 18 months and counting down until contract ends. Installation quality was unprofessional and the equipment is subpar.

Customer service is terrible - I've called 3 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $42 to $107 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 17 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $75/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $89 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $307 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "I've been dealing with Frontier for 12 months now and it's been frustrating. The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 100 Mbps, other times dropping to 25 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 5 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $34 to $122 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

The 100 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $77/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 2000 sq ft home. Coming from Xfinity where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $93 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $186 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $57/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $100 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $57 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I've been dealing with Frontier for 11 months now and it's been frustrating. The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 500 Mbps, other times dropping to 10 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 4 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $36 to $127 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $77/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $112 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

I signed up for Frontier 18 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 84% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $20/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $23 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 90 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 36 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $306 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $65 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $210 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $65/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $80/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $107 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 8 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends.

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $57/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $121 I was paying AT&T for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 18 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours.

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 100 Mbps, other times dropping to 17 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 6 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $44 to $126 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $45/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $94/month - over a 122% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $21/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $16 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 99 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 63% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 35 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $400 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

I signed up for Frontier 10 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $55/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $110/month - over a 99% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 48% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 17 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help.

Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas?

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $102 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $285 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $59/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $106 I was paying AT&T for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $59 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $108 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $288 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $88/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $106 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $88 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household.. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $83/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $113 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 8 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $83 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $82 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $276 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Bill has stayed at $78/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1500 sq ft home. Coming from Cox where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

Customer service is terrible - I've called 4 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $49 to $100 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $130 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 14 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $82 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $263 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $49/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $130/month - over a 132% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $20 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 57 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 62% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 29 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $206 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $69/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $101 I was paying AT&T for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $69 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $77/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $96 I was paying Spectrum for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $77 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $94 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $214 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $51/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $92/month - over a 95% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $25/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $15 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 59% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 30 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $244 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $63/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $72 every single month on my credit card!! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $238 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 8 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $47/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $107/month - over a 91% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 36 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 50% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 33 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $342 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $88 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $235 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If u ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $23 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 97 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 37% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 17 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $391 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "Had Frontier for 6 months in Austin and it's been excellent. The 500 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $77/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 2000 sq ft home. Coming from Cox where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 11 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $87/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $52/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $116 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $52 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 8 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $52/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 1000 Mbps, other times dropping to 38 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 8 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $45 to $102 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $124/month - over a 145% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $21/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 81 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 39% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 34 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $277 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 10 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $68/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $57/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $132 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $57 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $90/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $123 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window.

Now for the actual service - it's been 18 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads.

Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood.

The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $53/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $120/month - over a 136% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $15 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 97 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 37% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 21 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $362 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $55/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $97 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $55 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $60/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $97 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $60 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 1500 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $141. Service works okay but not worth the hassle. Support is slow to respond and unhelpful. Been with them 10 months and counting down until contract ends. Installation quality was unprofessional and the equipment is subpar.

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $76 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $187 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $84 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $255 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 7 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $62/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $38/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $120/month - over a 107% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 84 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 47% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 26 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $210 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1500 sq ft home. Coming from Cox where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $83/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $131 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $83 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 17 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $61/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $69 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $256 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $68 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $73/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $107 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $73 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing.

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $69 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $285 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 14 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $73/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago i called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $91 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $242 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1200 sq ft home. Coming from Spectrum where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in ur area.",

The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $35 to $124 per month with no warning.

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $70/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $100 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $70 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Equipment rental (${equip}/mo), broadcast fee (${tv}/mo), regional sports fee (${sports}/mo) - i don't even have TV!! Called to complain and they basically said tough luck, it's in the fine print. Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 3 outages in the last three months. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 6 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $63/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $116 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $63 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area.

Customer service is terrible - I've called 4 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $42 to $98 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $90/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $98 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $279 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $121/month - over a 124% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 53 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 56% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 34 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $237 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 100 Mbps, other times dropping to 23 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 4 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $40 to $108 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 13 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 100 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $90/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure i was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $96 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $196 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $54/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $91 I was paying AT&T for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $54 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 14 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $112/month - over a 116% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $17/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 55 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 44% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 35 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 4 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $289 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $62/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $50/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $125 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 9 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $50 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber 6 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (Spectrum) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 5 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $74/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $76/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $114 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $76 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $92 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $200 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $100 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $301 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do i even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 18 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $113/month - over a 125% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $25/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $11 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 93 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 68% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 23 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $203 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The 200 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $76/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from Cox where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $77/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $116 I was paying Spectrum for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $77 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 5 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $43/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $100/month - over a 108% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $25/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 93 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 50% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 19 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $344 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $55/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 2000 sq ft home. Coming from Xfinity where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $43/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $111/month - over a 117% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $21/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $23 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 74 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 48% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 20 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $343 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching 2 Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $51/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 18 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $51 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The early termination fee is $256 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The 500 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours.

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $72/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $105 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $72 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 128% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 52 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 62% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 43 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help.

But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $22 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 85 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 55% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 33 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $296 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $102 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $271 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $55/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $117 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $55 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $74/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $66/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $133 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $66 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $127/month - over a 122% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $19 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 96 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 42% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 16 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $303 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $52/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable.

Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 5 outages in two months. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 4 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

Customer service is terrible - I've called 8 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $43 to $95 per month with no warning.

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $122/month - over a 149% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $12/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 35 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 41% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 41 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $241 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $63/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1500 sq ft home. Coming from Xfinity where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $80 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $215 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $60/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $111 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $60 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $97 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $281 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $79 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $261 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $90 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $82 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $53/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $100/month - over a 132% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 84 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 52% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 37 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $279 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 8 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $78/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $64/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $103 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $64 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $71/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $102 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $71 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $78/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $140 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $78 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Bill has stayed at $90/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 2500 sq ft home.

Customer service is terrible - I've called 6 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $46 to $105 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $79/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $79/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $126 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $79 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber 18 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (Spectrum) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 5 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $82/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure i was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 100 Mbps, other times dropping to 36 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 5 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $32 to $108 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 15 months ago after their sales rep promised me 100 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $129/month - over a 83% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $23 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 96 Mbps on average instead of the promised 100 Mbps. That's only 59% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 20 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $205 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $86 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $219 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Had Frontier for 10 months in Austin and it's been excellent. The 500 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $82/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1500 sq ft home. Coming from Spectrum where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $61/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $99 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 17 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $61 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 1800 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $145. Service works okay but not worth the hassle. Support is slow to respond and unhelpful. Been with them 18 months and counting down until contract ends. Installation quality was unprofessional and the equipment is subpar.

I signed up for Frontier 13 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $50/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $105/month - over a 80% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $20 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 40 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 44% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 24 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 5 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $385 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising.

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $81/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $139 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 14 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $81 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 3 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $57/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

The 100 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $70/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1200 sq ft home. Coming from AT&T where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $39/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $126/month - over a 80% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $17 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 42 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 39% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 39 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $386 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $63 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $82/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $122 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 9 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads.

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 9 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $65/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $76/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $108 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $76 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $107 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $245 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 13 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $58/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

Install took 3 hours and left cables running across my ceiling in the ugliest way possible. Asked about running them through walls, was told that costs extra. The router they provided is garbage - WiFi barely reaches my bedroom in a 1200 sq ft apartment. Had to buy my own router for $136. Service works okay but not worth the hassle. Support is slow to respond and unhelpful. Been with them 6 months and counting down until contract ends. Installation quality was unprofessional and the equipment is subpar.

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $57/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $101 I was paying Cox for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 3 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $57 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $88 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $321 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Major issues with billing. Signed up at $30/month but actual bill is $480 after all the fees they don't tell you about upfront. Equipment rental (${equip}/mo), broadcast fee (${tv}/mo), regional sports fee (${sports}/mo) - I don't even have TV! Called to complain and they basically said tough luck, it's in the fine print. Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 6 outages in two months. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 3 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

    "review_text": "Switched to Frontier Fiber 18 months ago and very happy with the decision. Previous provider (Comcast) was unreliable with constant outages. Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 4 months. Speed tests consistently show 920 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $71/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

I signed up for Frontier 18 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $125/month - over a 127% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $25 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 40 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 55% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 40 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $334 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $62/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $101 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 8 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $62 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $87 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $314 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $78/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $124 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 15 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $78 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 7 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 500 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $88/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 3 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $44/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $100/month - over a 128% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $20 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 70 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 44% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 30 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 10 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $328 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $31 to $115 per month with no warning.

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $66 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $253 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1500 sq ft home. Coming from AT&T where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $87 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $197 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $70/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $122 I was paying Xfinity for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $70 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Had Frontier for 16 months in San Antonio and it's been excellent. The 1000 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $54/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from Spectrum where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $66/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $116 I was paying Comcast for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $66 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 7 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $54/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $112/month - over a 90% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $14/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $21 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 69 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 66% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 37 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $363 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 1000 Mbps, other times dropping to 28 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 5 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $36 to $102 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

    "review_text": "I've been dealing with Frontier for 5 months now and it's been frustrating. The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 1000 Mbps, other times dropping to 16 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 3 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $32 to $118 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

The 1000 Mbps fiber plan is perfect for our household - two people working from home plus kids streaming and gaming. Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $68/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1500 sq ft home. Coming from Xfinity where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $74 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $247 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in San Antonio, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 500 Mbps plan for $68/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $122 I was paying Comcast for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 12 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 500 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $68 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with AT&T's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $72/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $93 I was paying AT&T for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 5 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $72 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with AT&T's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $47/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $105/month - over a 143% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $16/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $8/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $17 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 56 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 50% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 15 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $281 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $84/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $104 I was paying Cox for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $84 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 10 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 1000 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $75/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $108 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $314 for service at an address I haven't lived at since May! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $67/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $106 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $67 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 11 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $37/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $126/month - over a 89% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $18 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 43% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 15 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $237 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $99 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $246 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 6 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $50/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $105/month - over a 82% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $13/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $15/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 88 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 59% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 44 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 3 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $358 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Xfinity's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $65/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $129 I was paying Xfinity for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 7 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $65 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Xfinity's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

I signed up for Frontier 7 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $127/month - over a 96% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $24/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $16 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 30 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 37% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 16 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 7 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $284 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

Equipment rental (${equip}/mo), broadcast fee (${tv}/mo), regional sports fee (${sports}/mo) - I don't even have TV! Called to complain and they basically said tough luck, it's in the fine print. Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Service itself is okay when it works but I've had 8 outages in six weeks. Each time I call they promise a credit that never appears on my bill. The whole experience feels scammy. Contract ends in 7 months and I'll be switching immediately. Check all the fees before signing up or you'll get burned like I did.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $81 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $286 for service at an address I haven't lived at since March! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $47/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped 2 $116/month - over a 100% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $23/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $14/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 81 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 69% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 42 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 8 times over the past 7 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $216 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in Los Angeles, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 1000 Mbps plan for $85/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $127 I was paying Spectrum for only 50 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 4 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 1000 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $85 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $42/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $108/month - over a 113% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $10/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $13 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 89 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 62% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 33 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $297 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $76 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $279 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Comcast's unreliable cable internet here in Austin, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $50/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $132 I was paying Comcast for only 100 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $50 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Comcast's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

The speeds are inconsistent - sometimes close to the advertised 1000 Mbps, other times dropping to 21 Mbps. This makes working from home nearly impossible during peak hours. Customer service is terrible - I've called 6 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $46 to $103 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $73/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Spectrum's unreliable cable internet here in San Diego, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 100 Mbps plan for $77/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $138 I was paying Spectrum for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 13 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 100 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $77 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Spectrum's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 15 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 500 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $53/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 1000 Mbps fiber for just $41/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped 2 $105/month - over a 131% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $15/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $13/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 80 Mbps on average instead of the promised 1000 Mbps. That's only 47% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 25 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $264 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $108 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $249 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $74/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Houston, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $51/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $135 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 6 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $51 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 18 months. Speed tests consistently show 480 Mbps on my 200 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $53/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $79 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $267 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 4 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $44/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $109/month - over a 145% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $19/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $11/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $14 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 30 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 68% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 24 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 6 times over the past 5 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $263 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $105 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $328 for service at an address I haven't lived at since July! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 9 months. Speed tests consistently show 950 Mbps on my 500 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $88/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

Customer service is terrible - I've called 8 times about the speed issues and each time they run diagnostics, say everything looks fine, and nothing changes. The last technician admitted the area is oversold but said there's nothing they can do. On top of that, my promotional rate ended and the bill jumped from $46 to $93 per month with no warning. Trying to negotiate got me nowhere. Really disappointed and actively looking at other providers. Would not recommend Frontier.",

I signed up for Frontier 16 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $35/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $125/month - over a 111% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $11/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $15/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $10/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $12 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 36 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 69% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 22 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 9 times over the past 8 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $348 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

I've called 10 times over the past 4 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $382 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $77/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time.

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $80 every single month on my credit card!! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $314 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 9 months ago after their sales rep promised me 200 Mbps fiber for just $45/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $119/month - over a 140% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $18/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $22 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 94 Mbps on average instead of the promised 200 Mbps. That's only 63% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 24 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 2 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $271 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $65 every single month on my credit card! The first month I thought maybe it was just a billing cycle thing and they'd credit it next month. When the second charge hit, I called immediately. Spent over an hour on the phone getting transferred between departments. One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $281 for service at an address I haven't lived at since April! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

Bill has stayed at $70/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from Cox where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

One rep said my account showed as cancelled, another said it was still active, a third claimed there was a 'pending disconnection order' that hadn't been processed. No one could give me a straight answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told someone would call me back within 24-48 hours. That was three weeks ago - no callback. Third charge hits and I'm absolutely livid. I call again, demand to speak to billing supervisor, get told the same thing about a callback that never comes. Meanwhile I'm out $245 for service at an address I haven't lived at since June! I've initiated chargebacks with my credit card company and filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my state's Attorney General office. Now Frontier has the audacity to send my account to collections for 'unpaid balances' - balances I DO NOT OWE because I cancelled properly! This is affecting my credit score. I've kept meticulous records of every call, every confirmation number, the equipment return receipt, everything. This company is either completely incompetent or deliberately defrauding customers. Either way it should be illegal. If you ever plan to cancel Frontier, be prepared to fight them for months to stop fraudulent charges. Absolutely criminal behavior from this company.",

    "review_text": "I am beyond frustrated with Frontier's customer service. Three months ago I called to cancel my service because I was relocating to another state for work. I followed their cancellation process exactly as instructed - called their number, spoke to a retention specialist who tried to keep me as a customer, I declined, got a confirmation number for the cancellation, and returned their equipment to an authorized UPS location with a receipt. Everything by the book. Yet here I am THREE MONTHS LATER still being charged $72 every single month on my credit card!

Frontier has been solid - maybe one brief outage in 13 months. Speed tests consistently show 190 Mbps on my 500 Mbps plan which is great. Work from home daily with video calls and large file transfers, no issues at all. Price is $55/month which is reasonable for the speed. Installation was professional and on time. The tech explained everything and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. Customer service the one time I called was helpful and knowledgeable. Only minor complaint is the router could have better range, but it works fine for my needs. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone in the area looking for fiber internet.",

    "review_text": "Where do I even begin with this nightmare experience? I signed up for Frontier 16 months ago after their sales rep promised me 500 Mbps fiber for just $36/month with 'no hidden fees.' That lasted exactly 12 months before my bill jumped to $104/month - over a 134% increase! When I called to ask why, they said the promotional period ended, which fine, I understand promos end. But the bill is itemized with all these fees that were never disclosed: $12/month equipment rental even though they said the router was 'included free,' $22/month broadcast TV surcharge for INTERNET ONLY service, $9/month regional sports fee (again, no TV service), and $24 in various mystery charges. The actual internet service itself is mediocre at best. Speed tests show I'm getting 33 Mbps on average instead of the promised 500 Mbps. That's only 57% of what I'm paying for. During evening hours it's even worse, dropping to 23 Mbps making streaming nearly impossible. I work from home and the connection drops randomly throughout the day - I've lost count of how many times I've been kicked out of important video meetings. Customer service is absolutely useless. I've called 4 times over the past 6 weeks trying to get help. Each time I spend 45+ minutes on hold, get transferred multiple times, explain the whole situation again to each person, and nothing ever gets resolved. Last tech who visited said the local infrastructure is 'at capacity' and there's nothing they can do about speed issues. So why do they keep selling service in oversold areas? The early termination fee is $205 which feels like being held hostage. I'm seriously considering paying it just to escape. Do NOT trust Frontier's advertising. The promotional price is fake, the speeds are fake, and support is nonexistent. Going to file complaints with FCC and BBB. You've been warned.",

Speeds are consistent throughout the day even during peak hours. Bill has stayed at $53/month as quoted, no surprise increases or hidden fees which is refreshing. Had one service issue early on and support resolved it quickly with a tech visit the next day. Installation was smooth, tech was professional and cleaned up after himself. The included router has good WiFi coverage for our 1800 sq ft home. Coming from Xfinity where service was spotty and support was awful, this has been a huge upgrade. Highly recommend Frontier if fiber is available in your area.",

    "review_text": "After years of struggling with Cox's unreliable cable internet here in Dallas, switching to Frontier Fiber has been absolutely life-changing for our household. Let me explain why this has been such a great experience from start to finish. The initial sales process was refreshingly straightforward - no high-pressure tactics, just clear information about what speeds were available at my address and honest pricing. I went with their 200 Mbps plan for $50/month which seemed almost too good compared to the $99 I was paying Cox for only 200 Mbps. Installation was scheduled within a week and the techs showed up right on time in the promised window. They were professional, explained everything they were doing, and took care to run the fiber line neatly without damaging my landscaping. The whole setup took about two hours and they tested everything thoroughly before leaving, even helping me connect my smart home devices and optimize WiFi placement. Now for the actual service - it's been 11 months and I honestly cannot remember the last time we had any issues. Speed tests consistently show I'm getting the full 200 Mbps I'm paying for, sometimes even slightly higher. This is actual fiber directly to the home, not the 'fiber to the neighborhood' fake fiber some ISPs advertise. The upstream is symmetrical too which is amazing for cloud backups and video uploads. I work entirely from home doing software development which means I'm on VPNs and video calls all day. My spouse also works remotely in graphic design uploading huge files. We have two teenagers who are constantly streaming, gaming online, and video chatting with friends. Plus all our IoT devices, smart TVs, tablets, etc. We regularly have 15-20 devices connected simultaneously and have never experienced any slowdown or congestion even during peak evening hours. Gaming latency is consistently under 15ms which my son says is excellent for competitive play. The reliability has been perfect - I think we've had exactly one outage in all this time and it was during a major thunderstorm that knocked out power to half the neighborhood. Service was restored within an hour of power coming back. The billing has been exactly as promised too - $50 per month, no hidden fees, no surprise increases, no equipment rental charges because the router is included. After dealing with Cox's bait-and-switch pricing tactics for years this transparency is so refreshing. The customer service the couple times I've needed to contact them has been responsive and knowledgeable. I highly recommend Frontier Fiber to anyone who has it available in their area. Best internet service I've had in my 20+ years as a consumer. Worth every penny.",
